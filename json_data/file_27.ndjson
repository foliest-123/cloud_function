Had to wait for 2 days for the technician but with the instructions from box, you can start yourself without waiting.In the box: 10 disposable mops, 1 washable mops, 2 side brushes, 1 main brush, Mopping plate, Deebot, Dust chamber with HEPA filter, Charging Dock, Cable, User Manual, Cleaning BrushCleaning performance: Superb cleaning with 4 power options - Quiet, Normal, Max and Max+. Lower suction means lower battery consumption. With higher suction power even the minutest dust particles will be cleaned up (Good if you have children in the house). Higher suction also means you need to clean the dust chamber more frequently. In all the 4 power options, the house will look clean and will collect most visible dust. The higher options are for deep cleaning. Also if you have groves or areas that accumulate dust over time in the flooring, the higher power will pull out dust from these tiny places.Cleaning Pattern: 1st edges of the room are cleaned and then it will run a north-south or east-west cleaning pattern inside the edges. No specific patterns like Y or Spiral)Mopping Performance: The mopping also has electronically controlled water usage - Low, Medium, High, Ultra High. The app shows warnings when using High and Ultra High (The robot may slip due to water on the floor) but I have been using High water flow on ceramic tiles and have not faced such a problem. The wheels of the robot have good grip which help with the higher water settings. The mopping will become more and more effective over time with usage of the reusable mopping pad (As it gets older, more area will touch the floor than a new mopping pad. For the 1st week, the mopping is not as good as the mopping pad does not entirely touch the floor but with usage the shape of pad will adapt and you will get better results.)Corner Cleaning: 1-2 cms of wall corners may not be cleaned, esp. if you don't have straight walls (E.g. if you have a bathroom door, which has a 1 cm cutout in the wall, then the corner area around the door might not be cleaned). 90 degree wall corners may have a 1-2 cm area which is not cleaned, however the side brushes are large enough for most of these corners. All other areas with obstacles, such as chair or table legs will be properly cleaned (Deebot may run around them 2 or 3 times).Corner Mopping: As the Deebot's mop is round, it will not reach the corners, expect a 5-6 cm area in the 90 degree wall corners not being mopped. However on straight walls, the cleaning is very effective as it may only miss 1-2 cms, which however will be cleaned by side brushes.IMPORTANT: If you have black furniture, Black stone / wall tiles, mirrors or any reflective furniture at the height where Deebot's Top mounted laser is located, the corner area near that black furniture will not be cleaned by Deebot. The laser is not able to properly recognize that it is a wall and will run a few centimeters away from that wall. This is important to consider if you have substantial amount of blacks in your house as the cleaning will be less effective.Mapping: The 1st run will map the entire house and you need to follow Deebot as it maps so that no areas are obstructed. Subsequent runs will update the map with any obstacles e.g chairs and tables if they were not initially mapped. The N8 version does not have additional sensors as the pro version. So it may crash into smaller items that the top mounted laser cannot directly see. Also, you can save at maximum of 2 maps at a time (2 floors). The 1st run will be a very random cleaning pattern. After the 1st run, you can edit the rooms (Divide or merge areas) and rename the rooms based on some preset options like Living room, bed room, kitchen, etc.). Once the rooms are mapped, Deebot will clean each room in the subsequent run and then you will be able to see proper cleaning pattern)The created maps are not editable (you cannot move or adjust boundaries). You have option to add virtual boundaries (as a line or as a rectangle box) where the robot should not go. This is extremely useful if you have mirrors or reflecting furniture at the height of Deebot. Deebot's laser reflects off the mirrors and assumes there is area of the house where it may be able to go (behind the mirror). So you need to manually block this mapped area behind the mirror with a virtual boundary or box. Deebot will automatically detect carpets and not mop over them (if you have installed mopping plate, then Deebot will ignore carpet area). Also there is an option to mark areas as no mop areas (Similar to Virtual boundary).Application Use: I used the android application for setup and regular cleaning functions. The app has an advanced mode, which works as per the stored map. If you turn it off, Deebot will start cleaning wherever you place it. E.g. I have a balcony which can't be accessed by the Deebot directly. I can pickup and place it in the balcony, turn advanced mode off and start cleaning. Once it is done, it will return to the place where you put it and notify that docking station is not accessible.The app also has 3 cleaning modes with advanced mode turned on. Area cleaning (Select a room or multiple rooms to clean), Auto clean (Clean the entire house), Custom Cleaning (Select an area on the map to clean).You can preset the sequence in which you want to clean the rooms. You can also set different vacuum and water levels for each room (or can use a common setting for the entire house). You can also preset how many times (Options are once or twice) you want to clean a specific room. You can also set multiple cleaning schedules based on which room you want to clean at what time of the day. Deebot will start working automatically. However, this is not advisable if you are mopping. As per the technician you must remove mopping plate after use. If any water leaks onto the parts, it may void warranty.There is an option to auto boost suction on carpets (to Max+). You can set the option for continuous cleaning, i.e. whether you want Deebot to auto restart cleaning if it runs out of charge midway. (Deebot will only recharge partially based on the remaining cleaning area, resume the cleaning, and then return to recharge - this saves time)The app also shows usage period of accessories in hours and the total expected usage time. It is an Ecovacs recommendation to replace the accessories - Side Brush, Main Brush, HEPA Filter. This area of the app also shows how to clean or maintain with images, which is really helpful.The app shows a history of cleaning cycles with maps. This helps to check if any areas were not cleaned.Cleaning and Maintenance: Expect that instead of cleaning the house daily, you will be washing the mopping pad every day and Cleaning Deebot once every week (depending on the size of your house). Cleaning will take around 30 to 40 minutes - remove all hairs from side brush, main brush and wheels, remove the dust chamber, remove the HEPA filter and wash the dust chamber, Wash the main and side brushes (if needed), Clean all the sensors of Deebot with a dry cloth, Let the washed accessories dry and then reinstall them. Also, remember that the investment in a robot is not a onetime cost. You will need to replace the accessories every 6-12 months based on the usage and maintenance. Consider the replacement cost also while evaluating a price point for investment in a robot vacuum.Overall Rating: 9/10 The cleaning and mopping performance is very good, and better than a house maid in most circumstances. (E.g. Deebot goes under the sofas). Expect manual work such as clearing the rooms before running the cleaning cycle, and cleaning areas out of reach of Deebot. In this price range, I am very satisfied with the performance.,", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31Ly7OehCGL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/ECOVACS-Robotic-Powerful-Advanced-Technology/dp/B0B19VJXQZ/ref=sr_1_323?qid=1672923609&s=kitchen&sr=1-323"}

It's a decent product in the affordable category. The floor attachment Particularly works very well. It is light weight and so cleaning lower end of ceiling fans was easy. The suction power when using sofa attachment is quite good in cleaning dust stuck in stitching corners. Overall, if you want to spend minimally and get all relevant attachments and your usage is for a 1 bed or a smaller sized apartment,  this product is a good start.,,Carpet bohot ache se clean nhi kar paata, baaki normal cleaning ache se kar deta he.,Got this vacuum cleaner after a lot of research and it has been a good choice till now. I wanted a handheld vacuum cleaner for both car and home cleaning purposes. My primary requirements were cleaning my car and gaming chairs/sofas. A car vacuum cleaner only wouldn't have suited the purpose. Also, I wanted a power-plugged vacuum cleaner as the one with a battery can be used only for a certain amount of time, and there is a long charging period of wait.This product ticks all the requirements. It has a 5m power cable that is long enough to use comfortably. The suction power is good at 16kpa, unlike the 6kpa of most battery-powered cleaners. Noise is okay, I mean it isn't so much to disturb someone until and unless someone is really allergic to noise.It has several components that helped clean my car and even my fabric gaming chair. And I was also able to see a visible difference in the window meshes.Yes, it gets heated after several minutes of usage, but I could use it with a wait of 2-3 minutes each time. Its weight is ample for horizontal and downwards usage. I haven't used the stick provided, and I think it might be a little bit difficult to use it upwards on walls if I need to use it continuously for 10 minutes or more.I had to be sure that the accessories were available after purchase, such as the filter, which I was able to confirm with customer care. It's a good buy. Let's see in the long run.It's made in China. The company provides 6 months of an extended warranty if a review is given and shared with them. This is a bit weird requirement to go ahead with. However, this isn't a sponsored review and is based on hardly a month's usage.Some photos are attached for help.,Nice product, but the filter strain was teared in one place, it needed to repair. But otherwise satisfactory. Build quality is very deplorable, they are just forcing the buyers to give 5 star by any means to give better service and warrenty assistance by a card inside the box, this seems really threatening.

it,Instant heating,Just go for it.,Best for instant heat water,Amazing products,Instant got water, quite literally", "review_content": "I bought \"Havells 3lts Instant Geyser 4.5KW White/Blue\" and I'm really happy I made this decision.Let me start with why I went for \"Instant Geyser\" instead of \"Storage Geyser\".-Storage geyser's have a tank to store water and heat it.-For example a 10litre storage geyser fills up the 10 litre tank and then heats the water.-As it has to heat high volume (10 lts) of water it takes time of about 5 to 10 minutes-Instant geyser's on the other hand heat water instantly within 1 to 3 minutes-However the catch is they dont have a huge capacity tank which means at a given instant it has only small volume(depending on tank capacity) of hot waterNow who should opt for \"Instant Geyser\" and who should opt for \"Storage Geyser\" is the question ?- If you like to have a \"Shower Bath\" for which you require more than 10 litres of hot water continously then you should go for \"Storage Geyser\" since storage geyser of capacity more than 10lts will store 10lts of hot water and provide it to you as soon as you turn on the shower without any pauses-Instead if we consider \"Instant Geyser\" of 3lts capacity for shower bath, it cant provide you 10lts of hot water continously because for every 3lts it takes time to heat water again-Hence for a shower bath better to go for \"Storage Geysers\"-If you like to have a \"Bathtub Bath\" then instant geyser's are good to go because-Consider using a bathtub, a bathtub generally is of capacity 350lts-If you even use a \"Storage Geyser\" of high capacity as much as 25lts, still you will have 14 pauses of 5 to 10minutes each-Because at one shot this storage geyser can provide you only 25lts of hot water continously and then you will have to wait for 5-10mins for the next 25lts to heat-So to fill the entire bath tub, you need to have 14 times 25lts of hot water = 350lts-So the total wait time would be 14 times 7mins (on an average) = 98mins-In this scenario of \"Bathtub bath\" its better to go for instant geysers since they provide hot water almost instantly and eventhough there will be pauses for every 3lts of hot water still the pauses being very small you'll have a bathtub full of water with enough amount of heat/hotnessThen you might ask what should we consider for \"Bucket Bath\" ?-Both \"Storage geysers of 15lts or above\" and \"Instant geysers of 3lts or above\" are good to go-Just choose based on:  Price,  Time taken to heat ( instant takes less time ),  Energy consumption ( instant comsumes less )Now coming to \"Havells 3lts Instan Geyser of 4.5KW\", why I bought this ?-Havells is a great brand-I wanted to have it for \"Bathtub Bath\"-4.5KW heats 3lts of water in just 30 to 50secondsWhat I liked about this product:-I have been testing it from a week and it is really ossum as it is heating 3lts of water in just 45seconds ( I have used a timer to note that )-The installation was totally free, however remember you will be charged if there is any \"Plumbing Work\" do be done.-No need to buy any extra accesories like pipes, everything is provided in the box, you just need to buy a 16amp plug which would be less than 100rs-As soon as the product was delivered by amazon, I got a message from havells saying they have registered my installation request and the very next day the instalaltion was done, thanks a lot Havells ( This might differ for you based on your location, I live in hyderabad)-I really like havells customer service-The geyser comes with 2 years of warrenty for the whole and 5yrs of warrenty on the tank-It has \"Auto Cutoff\" feature to stop further heating or wastage of electricity if you forgot to switch off ( however please switch it off once done because eventhough it has auto cutoff, still once the water in the tank cools down it will again start heating and the cycle repeats )-It shows color indication: \"Blue when its heating\" and \"Orange when it has done heating\" ( Have a look at the pictures I have attached)Note:-Go for the 4.5kw model if you want hot water instantly in 30 to 50seconds, the 3kw model might take 2 to 5mins to heat 3lts of water-Make sure it is 4.5kw model because I see reviews from other customers who say the \"Mustard\" colored geyser is not 4.5kw but 3kw ( better go for white and blue color to be sure ),Very nice product,Good product,4.5KW rated heater is able to heat water in minutes and maintain that temperature for continuous flow of hot water. Good product,Great product at great price.,Value for money and instantly warm water comes in just 2min,Havella water heater,Water heats up in 45-60 secs depending on the weather.This review is after using this water heater continuously for 10-12 days in December, in Kolkata, with one of the days being extremely windy and lowest temperature at 14-15 degree Celsius (during afternoon/ early evening hours). On the coldest day so far, it took around 1min &10-15seconds to heat up completely.If you don't have chronic pain, or arthritis, or this is not going to be used for very old people, whereby really hot water is required for bathing, I think it can work perfectly for winters with lowest temperatures upto 9-10 degrees, because I have chronic pain and use this to get really hot water and for a shower, not using a bucket, and it's manageable.Obviously can't be compared to steaming hot showers using a storage geyser, but this heats quite quickly, so can be used in the shower even with the low capacity.For that same reason, it can be used for multiple people, because by the time one person leaves the bathroom and the next enters, you'll have fully hot water, only of lesser quantity, so if you don't live someplace cold, or don't need very hot water but mildly hot water, this can be used for multiple people as well.Installation support was also good.No cons, only that if Havells introduces a 5l instant heater in the 4.5kW range, then that would be a game changer and might give storage geysers a run for their money because this is perfect for anyone who doesn't have their own home and might need to move around, because it's compact, and provides instant hot water.", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31991seDfcL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Havells-Instanio-3-Litre-Instant-Geyser/dp/B078JF6X9B/ref=sr_1_347?qid=1672923610&s=kitchen&sr=1-347"}

Turns out the \"cap\" was actually a pretty nice container to blend small amounts of anything. The container itself seems of great quality, has measurements on the side, and also comes with a lid so that nothing splatters outside when you're using the blender.2) There is also a holder with some nails if you wanna mount the blender on a wall.3) The blender itself is amazing to hold, looks great, and is pretty easy to use.4) The blender can even stand on its own if you have to leave it and attend to something else. If you place it vertically, you can leave it as it is.Cons:1) After over 15 seconds of continuous blending (that is, if I'm not just pulsing it but continuously blending), there is this smell of some sort that starts to come from the blender. I'm not sure if that's a sign of overheating, or if it's normal.2) There's this groove right above the blade, and every time I'm done washing, there's always a little residue that was hiding in that groove which always comes out a few seconds after I'm done washing, and I always have to go back to clean that.

It maintains fixed temperature enabling fermentation process. I gave one star less because it does not have any handles so holding the apparatus can be tricky as it has this smooth surface so it might slip off from hands. You have to be very careful while holding and handling this curd maker, if they give side handles and auto-cut off feature then it would be best.,Package arrived in good condition. Now need to contact company for warranty,Good product to settle hassle free yogurt. Only thing is it should automatically cut of power once yogurt is ready. Else yogurt tastes amazing.,Got the product,looks good... checking now,I am writing this review after using the product for three weeks. I have chosen this as 'Agaro' Brand seems to be more trustworthy and has 1.5 years warranty (1 year +6 months extra after registering)Good Things - It works as expected. For my taste and local weather conditions, it takes nearly 6 hours. This will vary based on individual taste and local weather conditions. Very light weight. Cleaning is easy and there is no problem even if there is a bit of spill.Not So Good Things - Quantity is not 1.2 liters, it is few ml more than 1 liter.Plastic covers are delicate and there is chance of them getting damaged while cleaning. In my opinion manufacturer should have a provided a optional spare set of covers.Considering the cost, build quality is sufficient (as it is Made in China)Length of the wire is 94cms and usually requires an extension,Good product,Good product,It's just amazing.

Hence a star less,It is good and easy to use, go for it,For First time users, steam ironing can be useful and may love this variant. I have used Siemens iron already and it's not working so on emergency ordered this model from this brand. Both brands are varying in specific parameters. Bodywise BD iron box is small in size. So it took little extra time in closing a single apparel iron. Weight also lighter. Steam consumes water very quickly like I used 100ml twice for 3 apparels.. Color variation observed from image on box and original product inside. Finally work wise okay and job done. This experience is from single use of BD box and first impression.

The quality is good just for the looks however the fins are very thin and unable to produce the same heat with same power as Bajaj.Although I am comparing it with Bajaj 13 fins still the room size was 12x10ft and borosil heater really struggled to even put the room to a comfortable temperature. With Bajaj it was done within half hour however borosil took even 2 hrs and still we were feeling uncomfortable.The fan placement is low and it doesn't converts that much heat for faster heater even with max settings.Please check both physically if possible, Bajaj is on a heavier side and fins are of good quality.Though I received 2 defective Bajaj heater ( physical dent on body) from cloudtail , I have again ordered the same. Hope this time it turns out to be good.No company is providing the details of the oil quality used in their product. Good luck.,I have used bajaj oil filled heater before. This feels more sturdy. I think havells and borosil make the best quality oil filled heater in terms of sturdiness and finish. Although it\u2019s a simple assembly but still I wanted to buy a good brand as it draws a lot of power and I was concerned about safety.It makes the room warm quickly. Based on the power mode you choose. It will make the room dry. I have seen people using  water vaporiser alongside but on low power I haven\u2019t felt too try in 1-2 hours of use.Overall, since it was borosil, I expected an even more beautiful look but since it works well I am happy. Easily 1.5-2 k costlier than its peers.,Using 3rd Party off-brand blowers for years, I finally took the leap and bought the 13 fin Volcano from Borosil. It has transformed the way with its reliability and efficiency.Packaging:The item was secured and packed very well with amazon packaging along with the original Borosil Packaging.Assembly:Using the provided guidebook was easy to understand. The unit comes as assembled but you have to attach the castor wheels which was pretty easy. Then all was left was to plug it in.Usage:The heater warmed up the 20ftx20ft room with relative ease. It has 3 power levels for the fan attached and a temperature regulator. The heater takes 5-6 minutes to heat up and bring the room up to temperature.Looks:The product looks very well and the black fin structure helps meld well with any decor you have in your room.Additionally, the two-year warranty and the safety features make it a must-buy product for winters.9/10 would buy again,Did not give the expected result,Ordered this OFR a month ago and have had used it since then. It is a powerful product to warm up the room pretty quickly. Although the first few minutes are slow but then it picks up the pace and evenly heats up the entire room. It is quite and doesn't even vibrate. I already own an OTG and an egg boiler and now the OFR.

Otherwise, it's quite quite useful, especially during winters.,Good looking but light weight. Not easy to clean.,Nice product,I bought this as it is made in india. It is light weight which is good and does its job well. The lid must be manually opened and must be pushed all the way up to hold. Initially it fell back but it needs to be push back to hold upright position.Am happy with itafter using it for two days.,Except for the cord length of the kettle which should be a bit more.Otherwise, THANK YOU FOR A GOOD PRODUCT.,Very nice,Good working,Heats well, less noisy and looks elegant. Cord is short and partially opening lid makes it difficult to clean. Has worked well so far.", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41RI-hzCnvL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Singer-Aroma-1-8-Litre-Electric-Kettle/dp/B07F366Z51/ref=sr_1_373?qid=1672923611&s=kitchen&sr=1-373"}
