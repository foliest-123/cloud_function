Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it's best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue,Above average performanceNo heating issueFastest fingerprint reader&face unloakGood battery lifeOk camera qualityLight weight,comfortable on hand,All the features of this mobile was good.no doubtly anyone can buy this but nor for games.withinh the budget only it was available for me.,Dual tone flash light is not working i think it's only single led light,Two things missing1.

Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.,It's good value for money smart watch.Light weight.

I'm happy!But, scratch resistance capabilities have to be checked yet.But, it's also a bit pricy!500 for 1 glass?Need to wait and check its life span and protection quality.,After putting lots of screen protectors, i found this was the easiest. No need to think about alignment as the alignment tray makes it a breeze. I found two big air bubbles after installation but those were removed very easily with the squeege tool. Overall, the process took hardly 10 mins. Just clean the screen properly before installing to avoid any dust mark below screen protector.,Good and easy to install,It\u2019s easy to install. Quality is great. Doesn\u2019t cause issues with camera and is better than the original screen itself in terms of touch feel,Oleophobic coating on it is really good. I\u2019ve been using it since over 2 months now and it\u2019s not faded at all. It\u2019s a bit expensive but it keeps phone\u2019s screen looking new and shiny, and it is much much better than the cheap ones in doing so; it\u2019s night and day difference.Fit and finish is really good too. Applying it is super easy.Otherwise, I don\u2019t see it protecting the phone screen from cracking or scratching more than the cheaper or the more expensive ones.I recommend getting this over others primarily because it\u2019ll keep your expensive phone looking new,the product is good, easy to install, and comes with a wonderful package but it's too costly, rs 1k, if u happen to get this for a discount or deal then go for it!,This screen protector is super quick and easy to install.

Biggest disadvantage of this device is it's in box charger which is only 7.75 watts (5v, 1.55a) that takes about 3 hours for a decent charge.,\ud83d\udd25 Heating issues during use with in 15 minutes uses.Touch screen \ud83d\udcf1 issues some times it's too great and some time u have to touch several times even on samsung key pad while typing.We all family are using samsung mobiles but this time I worried of issues if I have to face same issues i have to change mobile and transfer data it's very irritating work I wish to if any one of samsung is reading this review please reply me through Amazon.\ud83d\udd25 15 \u092e\u093f\u0928\u091f \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0909\u092a\u092f\u094b\u0917 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u094c\u0930\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0940\u091f\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0964\u091f\u091a \u0938\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0928 \ud83d\udcf1 \u0915\u092d\u0940-\u0915\u092d\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u092f\u0939 \u092c\u0939\u0941\u0924 \u092c\u0922\u093c\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0914\u0930 \u0915\u092d\u0940-\u0915\u092d\u0940 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u094b \u091f\u093e\u0907\u092a \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u0938\u092e\u092f \u0938\u0948\u092e\u0938\u0902\u0917 \u0915\u0941\u0902\u091c\u0940 \u092a\u0948\u0921 \u092a\u0930 \u092d\u0940 \u0915\u0908 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u0938\u094d\u092a\u0930\u094d\u0936 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u092a\u0921\u093c\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964\u0939\u092e \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0930 \u0938\u0948\u092e\u0938\u0902\u0917 \u092e\u094b\u092c\u093e\u0907\u0932 \u0915\u093e \u0909\u092a\u092f\u094b\u0917 \u0915\u0930 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u0932\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0928 \u0907\u0938 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0926\u094b\u0902 \u0938\u0947 \u091a\u093f\u0902\u0924\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u0942\u0902 \u0905\u0917\u0930 \u092e\u0941\u091d\u0947 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0926\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u093e \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u092a\u0921\u093c\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0924\u094b \u092e\u0941\u091d\u0947 \u092e\u094b\u092c\u093e\u0907\u0932 \u092c\u0926\u0932\u0928\u093e \u0939\u094b\u0917\u093e \u0914\u0930 \u0921\u0947\u091f\u093e \u091f\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0902\u0938\u092b\u0930 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u0939\u094b\u0917\u093e \u092f\u0939 \u092c\u0939\u0941\u0924 \u092a\u0930\u0947\u0936\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u093e \u0915\u093e\u092e \u0939\u0948 \u0905\u0917\u0930 \u0915\u094b\u0908 \u0938\u0948\u092e\u0938\u0902\u0917 \u0907\u0938 \u0938\u092e\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e \u0915\u094b \u092a\u0922\u093c \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0924\u094b \u0915\u0943\u092a\u092f\u093e \u092e\u0941\u091d\u0947 \u0905\u092e\u0947\u091c\u093c\u0945\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u092e\u093e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u092e \u0938\u0947 \u0909\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0902 .,Bought for mom as she just want to use for calls. She is not a selfie or video person.Didnt want to go for Realme/Xiaomi(redmi/poco) products because of their support. This already comes with Android 12 and two year updates are assured.The display is really good. Not full HD screen though. Call quality is good.I wanted a smaller size but unfortunately, the price doesnt fall under 10 for them.If you are buying for lots of photos/videos, this is not the phone for you.If you want to use for call & do basic things like whatsapp and other things, this would be a good phone for you.,This phone was bought for a first time smartphone user.  It was a good fit for the said user.  Thank you Samsung and Amazon.,Normal phone with very average screen quality. Battery backup also not very good. But yes its worth it.

I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.  Nothing Fancy but for the budget it is a good phone.,BATTERY : more than enough for normal use  Not sure in gamingCAMERA : good in this segment , can record  videos in FHD 30fpsDISPLAY : since it's a LCD display the quality is  a bit less , but goodV RAM : you can add upto 2gb of virtual ram  but have to sacrifice your storage  Space to use it  OVERALL A GOOD BUDGET PHONE,Finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413sCRKobNL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Midnight-Storage-5000mAh-Battery/dp/B0B4F1YC3J/ref=sr_1_162?qid=1672895791&s=electronics&sr=1-162"}

Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it's best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue,Above average performanceNo heating issueFastest fingerprint reader&face unloakGood battery lifeOk camera qualityLight weight,comfortable on hand,All the features of this mobile was good.no doubtly anyone can buy this but nor for games.withinh the budget only it was available for me.,Dual tone flash light is not working i think it's only single led light,Two things missing1.

No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!,Good smartphone for daily use, good battery life, doesn't hang much. My usage is normal and I don't play games, so did not experience heating issues. Received updates, now  running on Android 13 after latest update.,I write review after using this device almost 1 month 24 days.SAMSUNG GALAXY M32 PRIME EDITIONRAM: 4GBROM: 64GBCOLOUR: BLACK#AmazonSeLiyaI purchased it on Amzon Great Indian Festival.Ordered placed on 22 September 2022Ordered delivered on 26 September 2022.Delivery package was decent.It's a complete package within 11K price range.It's working absolutely fine in day to day normal usage. You can also play game like BGMI, FREE FIRE MAX, CALL OF DUTY without no lagging.Pros:1. Super Amoled Display2. Battery Backup (Normal usage 2.5 days & Hard usage 1.5 days), SOT(Screen On Time): Youtube video with 60% brightness approx 10hours+3. OneUI 4 Out of the box with Android 12.4. Network Connectivity.5. It's size. 6.4 inch display. Hand comfortable.6. 25W charging support.7. Virtual RAM upto 4gb.8. Always On Display9. 20MP selfie was great quality.10. 64MP true camera (It's camera quality is great with 15000 price point)Cons:1. 15W charger inside box.2. Video recording with 1080p only.3. Camera capturing sound turned off option is not present.4. No 4k video support.5. Speak volume was decent. Not much louder.6. Fingerprint is not fast.7. Face lock is not determine properly.8. No 4g+But It is a quality product from Samsung.If you get it around 11K price point then it's a great deal ever.Go for it if you don't need 5g.,Pros- 1. sAMOLED display,  2. 64mp Rear & 20mp Front camera,  3. One UI,  4. Knox security,  5. 6000mAh big battery.Cons- 1. Helio G80 Processor(should be at least Helio G96 or equal),  2. Lots of lags & Jittering issues. (It must be fixed & improved through software updates).  3. eMMC storage (should be UFS storage),  4. No carrier aggregation support.  5. Only 15w charger in the box (should be at least 18w or 20w fast charger).,Writing this review after using it for 6..7 months..my father is using this one..good for normal use. I bought it for around 14000.What I don't like about this phone is camera quality. Without flashlight the photos are quite good,but when we click pictures with flashlight on the quality is not good at all..so that\u2019s the main concern in this phone.Hope this issue can be solved with a update.There is no heating problem, phone is working very smoothly.,I am writing this review after 3 month of use. Phone is overall good. Battery life is good. Display is also very good. Phone has no heating issue although I have not played any games on the phone.,Phone is good for normal use  display is very goodBut I  faced  some jitters in while display light goes off.. it happened many times before updated the phone after update it happens rarely...,Multiple issue in Samsung M32 .1.Lock Screen password issue. We can't reset the password if you get the lock screen password you have to reset mobile and there is no option for password reset.2.My Phone Samsung M32 is not getting charged after usage of 1 year.3.Sometimes phone is hang issue and not responding.4.I would recommend not to buy Samsung M series ,If you buy means you would face so many issue and will get frustration definitely.5.This is my first and last mobile in Samsung.", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41jna+YGP+L._SY300_SX300_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Prime-Light-Blue/dp/B0BD3T6Z1D/ref=sr_1_193?qid=1672895806&s=electronics&sr=1-193"}
