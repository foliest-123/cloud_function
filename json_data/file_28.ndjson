On geyser and wait till water gets heated (2-3mins) ON TAP and fill bucket with hot water.2. OFF TAP and wait for another round of water heating then again fill bucket and leave the tap ON untill bucket filled with warm water.3. If u need more hot water repeat steps 1 &2.Cons:-1. One need to purchase inlet & outlet pipes which costs around 400 as this was not provided by orient.Writing review after 20+ days usuage.,Heater is so slow as compare to Bajaj heater ... currently i purchased this 1 but it's not good,I have ordered two of them . Installed in bathroom as well . There is a trick to use it in bathroom. Either turn tap really slowly or by turning on tap at full sppeed. Whenever the the water get cold again switch of the tap , after 3 to 5 minutes again on and fill. Just this compromise you have to make in place of storage geysers.,Product body fitting is average. Be prepared to spend another 600-700 R's. on installation pipes, 16A plug and installation charges. No installation plate with geyser. To be mounted on screws. No safety valve supplied with geyser. Overall average product. Better go for Havells which comes with all accessories.,Easy to install.Temprature controller is not available with this product..Till date working good.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/51IzGNDZ7eL._SY88.jpg,Ordered on 7th feb 2021. Received as per delivery date. On opening found that the unit is wrapped with plastic and found water droplets. Maybe they tested the product before delivery. Coming to the product, it heats water to boiling temp in 3-4 minutes and you can expect 4 jugs of hot water only.Delivery:5/5Packing:1/5 \u2014 since no bubble wrap or anything to protect the product.Product:3/5\u2014 you should not design a product with such low capacity, now I am struck after buyingLooks:5/5Will update more later...,First of all this is not a storage geyser. this is instant water heater. So better to understand the feature before using it. Just switch it on and wait for 1-2 min. it will start supplying hot water . As i told this is not a Storage geyser like 5-25 Ltr.  It comes with 3lts capacity only with 3KVA. So once the set temperature reach . Then Open the Hot water TAP in normal/Slow running speed .So that it will continue supplying Hot water/ warm water. If the Hot water Tap will be fully opened with full speed then this instant water water will not get sufficient time to warm the water. Hope this review will be helpful.", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/21vWJo4CXKL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Orient-Electric-Aura-Neo-IWAN03WSM3/dp/B077BTLQ67/ref=sr_1_374?qid=1672923611&s=kitchen&sr=1-374"}

Lov my coffee made in this! This should be advertised as suited for 4 cups not 6.,Does the job well and even after placing directly on the stove there is no discolouration. Steel quality is upto mark.,I have been using this product for a while and have no complaints. Makes amazing filter coffee.,Looks and quality are at par with other brands in its price bracket. In function, this kind of a mokapot design is flawed at the cleaning aspect, including this particular model, in my observation. In it, the pressured boiling water pushes through the coffee powder in bulk together, thus rendering the flavour inferior to what is brewed otherwise when the water percolates little by little. Secondly, the portafilter type coffee powder container, positioned just above the boiler chamber, sends some dissolved coffee back to the boiler water through the upward pressure pipe, rendering the entire remainder water mixed with coffee go waste. Thirdly, the coffee powder container's gasketted mesh is sedimented too while filtering the forced brew upward. So, when a person like me thinks of preparing a brew in a mokapot like mechanism, the very thought of the predicament of dismantling the the tiered chambers, separating the gasket, and then wash the pot thoroughly, because coffee is lurking everywhere therein to cause unhygienic residues, dampens my desire to go for it. I am no debater if the idea is to leave the pot just rinsed and washed and not rid it of the residues. All this is not the case with the downward filteration method of the other types of coffee machines that are absolutely unmessy. No offense meant for any system, this is my personal opinion.,I like the convenience of making coffee for 2-3 people in one go.Its very easy to clean it up after every use.

So yeah.,Very good kettle and big in size,Cord length is good,It is very robust in temperature control. That is to say on and off manual and automatic off. Regarding cord, it is 1500 watts kettle which is on the top of ordinary Indian domestic non power 6A plug. They have given one meter quality wire  with 6A plug.  This means if your home wiring can stand 1500 watts on ordinary non power plug you can use it in any socket anywhere. (The switch in the kettle is bit wobbly, not sure whether it is purposely designed so: initially I was not pleased, now love it because of majestic performance),Product looks good.

I have got two of em!", "review_content": "I gifted it to my mother last month; it was like love at first sip! easy to use, easy to clean, easy to flex, a blessing for any Indian adult! Still new to french press coffee, so I used South Indian filter coffee for the past few weeks and could instantly feel the difference between a cup of freshly pressed coffee and one of instant coffee, although I have been advised to try grinding my own beans for optimum enjoyment. I seep my grounds for around 3-4 minutes after heating the press for around a minute or so with hot water and am amazed at how heat-resistant the glass is, I would however still advise taking precautions. The markings inside also provide a great measurement of how many cups I would end up making. Not only have i used it for making coffee, but also to froth milk and to make tea. Attaching photos of a coffee i made using this french press with a layer of frothed milk. Ngl, one of the favorite purchases my family made, am thoroughly pleased and highly recommend it to anyone.,Time saving coffee/filter.,Been using this for many months now and it's great. Love that it has line measurements. Only thing is I wish the top surface had an arrow-type bump on the plastic to point where the holes are you so you don't have to look down but you can just tell by touch.,Delivery: Amazon delivery is always reliable and it didn\u2019t fail me this time too..Packaging: Both outer packing and the product packaging were intact. Product packing had the right information and was very usefulProduct: Very compact. We used several coffee makers in the market, but all required electricity to run. We wanted to have a non electric one which we can easily carry for outdoor and this one fits aptly to our requirements. Just add the coffee powder and hot water. After a while when we press the central pipe, coffee comes out. The nozzle makes it convenient to pour it a cup.For this price in great India sale, I think it\u2019s worth. I am inclined to give 5 star, but reserving 1 star now. Will use it for a month and come back here to change my rating if it still satisfies me.,Good one for a Black coffee lover,Very very happy with Cafe JEI's French Press. It has become an important part of my daily ritual now in past 10 days. Easy to use and maintain and would recommend buying without hesitation.,Instruction manual could have been a hard copy..too much steps to get the ebook,Got this French Press last year and another one few days back! One for Coffee & another for Green / Black Tea.Totally value for money.
