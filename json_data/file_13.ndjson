Be careful with the wire though as it can get tangled easily and is not that strong.,Best buying in these range,The C50 HI is a budget friendly in ear earphone and it really comes at a great price.But the next version of these i.e. C100SI has more value for money factors.Like C50 HI has angled 3.5mm jack whereas C100SI has the normal one and i am not supposed to say this but trust me C100SI has the best best best and superior sound quality if I compared to C50HI.Though it doesn't have a great durability.But if your previous earphones were c100si and you are switching on these then one can definitely notice the difference between the c100si and c50hi although you can adapt the sound of c50hi in nearly about 1 week if you are switching from c100si.To be honest the c100si is literally best in all circumstances such like gaming,Listening to music and professional editing the vocals,mids highs lows are perfectly balanced in c100si but not c50hi.in c50hi mostly when listening to sing the bass was not up to mark and the vocals were so loud that the bass was literally fading main point is that whenever we hit the full volume both of them never distorted any single beat.Hat's off to harman.,Good earphones short time usage.,Its good with very clear voice and average Bass clarity. I am not giving 5 stars because certain Bass can be improved a bit more. Overall its a good one.,Was looking for budget earphones with voice clarity, JBLC50 HI does the work.

Review is based on testing done the same day:Summary:The product is genuine and sturdy, but the performance is just about average, based on a random file copy performance to fill the entire space.Pros & Cons (comparing with SanDisk Cruiser Blade 32 GB) :Pros-1. Solid body, looks and feels great.2. Read speed is fine (22 MB/s).3. Product is genuine, covered under 2 Year manufacturer warranty.Cons -1. Fits too tight in usb port, thus causing more wear to the port and may even damage it if not used carefully.2. Capacity is 31 GB (precisely 31042043904 bytes), not 32 as advertised. In windows it'll show up as a 28.9 GB drive compared to 29.8 in Sandisk. No big deal, just a technical observation.3. Write speed (3.3 MB/s) is not bad, but slightly inferior to its close competitor Sandisk cruiser blade which easily gives 4 to 4.4 MB/s for the same test.4. Warranty is only 2 years, compared to 5 years on Sandisk. But since almost nobody claims warranty after 2 years, and besides- the plastic body of Sandisk gets physically damaged in 2 years anyway, so it's okay for me.Bottomline:It's good enough for casual users, maybe chosen over Sandisk for its look, feel and sturdiness. Frequent users may want to look for better options- with easier port fitting and better write speed.Details:The product name is HP v236w as shown on its packing (the images in listing are correct) while its part number is FD236W-32, so slightly confusing but both are the same thing.Testing whether it is genuine or fake:The bottom of the hologram sticker on the packing has a silver layer with \"scratch and check\" written on it. Scratching it reveals a 20-digit code beneath it, and the right edge of the sticker has the url \"www.pny.com.tw\" to verify this code. Go to support > product authentication page on that url. That page contains instructions and explanation of the results that you may get. Mine were originals, with the codes tested for the first time (repeat test result will be a warning that the code was tested before).So that means it is covered under 2 year manufacturer warranty, as declared by hp for Aisa Pacific region.Design and build quality : Sturdy, stylish but with a design flaw-It is exactly as shown in the picture. The body is a solid steel case with open front and the back sealed with a black plastic cap. The plastic back fits perfectly and gives it a stylish look, though it may come off later. The HP logo, product code etc are embossed on the steel body so likely won't be erased with time. Overall, it looks and feels great. The flaw I noticed was that it takes significantly more strength to push it into the usb port, compared to other usb devices like generic usb cables or usual plastic pendrives like Sandisk. You almost have to fight with it to push it in or pull it out. This means its frequent use can wear out the usb port too soon, or may even break it if not used carefully.Capacity : 31 GB, not 32, will appear as 28.9 GB in windows-It is advertised as a 32 GB drive but the actual capacity is 31GB, and yes, I'm fully aware of the decimal vs binary calculation difference, I'm a hardcore linux user. To be precise, its exact capacity is 31042043904 bytes (on both pendrives I tested). So in windows it will show up as a 28.9 GB drive. In linux it will show up as either 31 GB, or 28.9 GiB (binary calculation like windows). For comparison, my 32GB Sandisk shows up as 32010928128 bytes, or 32 GB, or 29.8 GiB. This loss of 1 GB in a 32GB pendrive is no big deal for me, just a technical observation.Performance:Read speed: about 20-22 MB/sWrite speed: about 3.3 MB/sTested with : a collection of ISO files ranging from about 350MB to 4GB, along with a few smaller files like pdf or txt. Total size of the collection was about 30.2 GB (28.2 GiB).I did this testing on linux, so to be fair, the write performance may be slightly better on windows as it works better with fat32 that the pendrive comes formatted as.(Edit: No performance difference on Windows either. Formatted as exFAT on windows 10 to make it multiboot with YUMI. Read-write speeds were same while copying ISO files to it, or reading them to load in memdisk while booting.)I could do more accurate testing with tools like dd command but didn't bother as the difference usually isn't very significant.,Ups.....The product is very good, i mistakenly washed it 8n washing machine with my pants but it is still running like new. No data loss problem or data corrupt problems i have faced yet.Downs......The only downside is this pendrive is little slow because of technology 2.0(3.2 is newer one)And second one is not affact your data at all.. the silver paint on pendrive is vanishing time by time and it is now turning black,Product is good but slow,Storage is good but doesn\u2019t work for car stereo,57 GB OUT OF 64,So far so good,Good product,Ok", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31febYa30qL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/HP-v236w-64GB-USB-Drive/dp/B01L8ZNWN2/ref=sr_1_21?qid=1672902995&s=computers&sr=1-21"}

I wanted a wired earphone and when I searched on Amazon I found Boult in such a low price and I ordered it. Recieved it today.Checked it by connecting to my phone and I was surprised by the audio quality. This is a nice product in this price range and the mic is also good. The build quality is average and you can't complain considering the price. It also has a clip to attach the earphone to your shirt like the good old Nokia days. It has total 3 pair or ear tips (2 in a zipper packet and 1 already attached to the earphone).  The manufacturing date is March 2022. So, it's quite new actually, not an old stock. It also has that anti-slip ear hook, which is an added advantage. In general, it is a good product for this price.,I was looking for reliable Bluetooth earbuds on a budget, and settled on these. Personally, I am pleased with them. I have been using them for almost four months now, including one month when they saw around 12 hours of use per day.PROS:\u25aa Comfortable.\u25aa Elegant and sober appearance.\u25aa Reasonable battery life. I would let the earbuds recharge at, for example, mealtimes.\u25aa Decent range. Going a few meters into the next room, with a concrete wall in between, was no issue.\u25aa The battery status of the dock is shown by a series of LED blinks. Simple and practical.CONS:\u25aa Mediocre phone calling quality. In particular, the microphone. The few conversations I had using these went successfully, so this was not a deal breaker, but the clarity was not the best for sure.The touch controls were initially a drawback for me, but I got used to them. Also, this product does not come with a charger. Either charge off of your computer, or buy a charger with the recommended electrical output. As for the sound quality, it is acceptable, not superlative. I have listened to music, and I have watched films and YouTube videos, with no problem.As a final note, I prefer this type of earbud over the in-ear type, because I find it more hygienic. Wiping with a clean cloth after each use, and leaving the lid of the dock open for some time, should help to slow fungal growth.,Very Good Product, nicely fits in the ear and comfortable .The Volume seems to be a little low at the highest.But, A good Buy,Sound quality is good everything is balanced but bass dominance is too high and couldn't hear the treble and other notes,very good bass quality And Worth for money earphones I ever Buy.. also Product Quality is awesome \ud83d\udd25\u2764\ufe0f,it doesn't fit as snugly in my ears, maybe it is cause of greasy ears, but the product is good, highly recommended,,Bolte audio bass is very good", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31DbAD6EoCL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Boult-Audio-X1-Earphones-Cancellation/dp/B07TCN5VR9/ref=sr_1_28?qid=1672902996&s=computers&sr=1-28"}

So I took the risk of ordering it and it turned out to be nightmare right out of the box, as the sound output was worse than my smartphone earphones. So I went to search for best settings on amazon & other sources but in vain. Fortunately I myself in experiments found the solution and now its working just fine.First I am mentioning all the pros and cons considering the settings that I found and then listing those settings,PROS :-------1. Built quality of the complete mic and cable is good for the price given.2. Length of cable is insane (20 feet).* I personally didn't find it useful, as I use it with my smartphone which is just couple of feet below in my pockets, but for some users it can be very useful if using in rig setup with Camera.3. Has universal 3.5mm jack, which is handy.4. Its easy to use, just plug and play device, which doesn't need any sound card or external device to work.5. Has support for multiple device right from smartphones to DSLRs and computers.6. It comes with carry pouch which is very handy, since its a mess with such long cables.CONS :--------1. Biggest con is the sound quality right out of the box. Its just garbage quality and even normal ears can't bear the background noise collection, so forget about audiophiles. My normal smartphone's earphones record much better sound quality compared to this.2. Length of cable is way too much for me and I guess for many users. I think there should have being multiple option on length to choose from, as keeping 20 feet cable wrapped and hanging or in pocket while recording is not comfortable.3. It comes with a button cell for recording sound for devices other than smartphone and there's NO way to know whether the battery is dead or what's its charging level. Only way to check is by plugging it to a digital recorder or computer and test. So if you are carrying it with recorder which doesn't has playback feature or if you are in hurry and in case of dead battery to record all the sound, then only way to find that your efforts are in vain will be when you comfortably sit to edit it and trust me, its very frustrating ! I am mentioning, it as this scenario have happened with me once, hence I am very cautious about batteries now & use it with smartphones or digital recorders.4. I think price should have being couple of hundred bucks less, considering the sound quality.BEST SETTING USING AUDACITY SOFTWARE :===================================These are the settings when you record with smartphone or any other device and there are lots of background noises and you use Audacity software, which is Free !1. Open the software and open the audio file you recorded with this mic.2. Select entire audio clip and open \"Effects\" and then \" DISTORTION \"3. Start the playback of audio clip in the software, so you can listen to change in effects that you are about to make.4.Now select \" Distortion Type \" option on the top of box and select \" Soft Clipping \".* or select \" Hard Limiter \" and do the settings as it sounds suitable to you.5. Take the \"Clipping Level cursor to extreme Right end or so until you hear soft pleasant output.6. Adjust the \"Make-up Gain\" cursor little bit if needed, I keep it on 49.* Here you can select which ever type, which you feel is suitable for you.7. Now just click \" APPLY \".8. Now is Noise reduction. For that Select short section of audio which DOES NOT have your voice, but ONLY has background noises that you don't want.9. Open \"Effects\" and then \" Noise Reduction \"10. Click on \" Get Noise Profile\".11. Now select entire audio clip and again Open \"Effects\" and then \" Noise Reduction \".12. Finally, click on \" OK \" and that's it !Now you are good to go with soft, slightly lesser Noises and more pleasant sound output. After these steps, you can amplify the sound from same software or any other end user software.VERDICT :-----------I personally am very disappointed with the sound quality, though the audacity tweaking gets it to bearable level, but its satisfactory enough. Plus price seems slightly more on this. I wouldn't recommend these are someone looking good sound quality specially if you live in noisy environment. Buy this only if you live in very silent conditions.,It's not great or best out there for beginners but good-I use a budget mid-range phone and the boya mic is better than in built mic of phone. record it in WAV format, it's good.-You gotta use software/apps to pull the best of this, like audacity or some other editing app.-It's pretty long and that's good as you can extend the cable to a good distance say if u r connecting it to the camera on a tripod.-Overall it's decent for beginners. I see high-end phones have good recording capabilities, but if you have a budget phone, then this one is deal.,Microphone looks very well built, it supports both phones and cameras. There are some phones that does not support external mic, please check before buying as one of my phone did not support it.They claim noise cancellation, however, I did not notice major difference it also captures great amount of noise, only cancellation is because of foam padding around the microphone. I could not observe noise cancellation, at least, while recording on phone.Overall package is well bundled, wire quality is decent, however the dongle quality is excellent, even the small clip to hold the microphone feels solid.,Wire is to long but good if quality of wire is improve in future then 5 stars from me but now 4 star good sound low price 1 star - for wire quality but over all a nice product.\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606,I think It's good for online teaching like I do...But yeah some problems like very long cable length I mean someone might need but it should be optional.... or detachable price of the Mic itself is not much anywaysI am okay with this mic for sometime... until I am sure I need quality Rode mic to upgrade...,Don't expect noice cancellation under this budget but audio recording quality is very good.,Nice product,Decent", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UYenF+lnL._SX300_SY300_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Boya-Omnidirectional-Lavalier-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B076B8G5D8/ref=sr_1_32?qid=1672902996&s=computers&sr=1-32"}

Go for bassheads 242 if you are spending this much. They are charging more for the metal enclosure and the braided cable. The angled jack is a plus but the sound quality is so-so. Infinity zip 100 and their own bassheads 242 are way better for sound.,I would like to start by saying I'm not an audiophile, therefore my review will be less about the audio quality of the product and more about the over all experience regarding the product. First off, this is my second time buying the product and you guessed it, it's good enough that I will buy it a third time if need be!Upon unboxing we are greeted by the presence of 3 pair of extra ear buds . There is also a pair of ear fins in the packet containing the extra ear buds, these ear fins are used to keep the ear buds snugly in your ears during strenuous periods of use where there is a chance of lots of movement. More on this later.Coming to the ear phones itself, it's among the very few ear phones that genuinely feels premium in hand. It is very durable, specially the plug part that connects to your phone, many a time my ear phones stop working because the plug part malfunctions and causes problems in the functioning of the ear phones. This is not the case with these.The wire itself is made of rubber/silicon. It feels good in hand and the only thing I can think of that could be improved here is to braid the wire but so far the wire hasn't showed any form of wear and tear common with most other ear phone wires. Another thing to emphasize is that the entire cable is flat through out, this genuinely decreases the number of instances where I find myself trying to untangle the wire. This is truly one of the best features of this pair of earphones.Remember I said something about the ear phones being made completely of metal? Well it continues to the mic and the left and right splitter. Both these pieces feel very premium because of the signature cold feeling of metal against skin. I don't know about you but attention to small details like this always brings smiles to my face. It is to be noted that the mic piece is a universal single button type and hence cannot control volume, personally this problem didn't affect me much but the might be potential buyers who might find this to be a deal breaker.Mic quality is subject to individual bias therefore I can tell you my personal experience. In my opinion I feel that the quality is average, it won't blow anyone's mind but it will deliver most of the time. A common complaint I heard from most of my callers that they find it difficult to hear me when there is a significant amount of back ground noise or wind rustling in to the mic, these are common issues even with ear phones price significantly higher than the boAt BassHeads 152Finally the most important part of the review, the sound quality of the ear phones. As I said earlier I won't be going into the technical details . I am a bass lover and that is what led me to buy this pair in the first place. In my opinion I found that the Bass is indeed good but not over powering for the average consumer like how the Extra bass versions of the Sony line up of earphones trend to be. The volume gets sufficiently high and more often than not I use it at less than half it's total volume when listening to music. The clarity of the boAt BassHeads 152 are above par and easily betters even ear phones in the 2000 INR price category this is one other reason why I love this pair so much. A point to remember, as the entire covering of the ear phones is made of metal it is significantly heavier than other ear phones. This becomes a double edged sword, on the one hand the metal makes the ear phones feel very premium but it also makes it significantly heavier than other earphones made of plastic. This causes it to easily fall out of your ears if the supplied fins are not used. The find unlike the ones find in let's say the newer Bose ear phones aren't as comfortable and can hurt your ears if used over a prolonged time.Last but not the least, there are multiple color variants of the boAt BassHeads 152 including red, black and blue. I found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be a personal opinion but I find it to be the best of the three. That said I do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is a neutral color. This leaves out the red, for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at a lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales, therefore if you are short on cash and just want a great pair of ear phones then grab these while they last.Pros:1) No metal build2) Excellent wire quality and trendy3) Durable4) Above average sound qualityCons:1) Metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily2) Supplied Fins are uncomfortable to wear over a prolonged time3) Supplied Clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easilyI hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the BassHeads 220. All suggestions are welcome.Thanking you, Dwarakesh,Best quality  I like boat earphone saund quality,Only disadvantage  I noticed was this can't be use in USB phones,  3.5 mm jack is provided so it can be  usedin Jack phones only .,Nice,good,I used this headphone for travel.

And amazing amazon service!!,Good watch in this price,Watch faces could have been better,Amoled Screen & Touch, Average Wrist Band.", "review_content": "Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros# Amoled Display is very bright and nice# Look and design is premium# Bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..,Recieved a damaged device at first... Slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....The replacement was good...Amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..ProsSmooth enough UIFairly accurate readings on all the sensorsHeartrate BP and spo2Call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..You can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... And it is seamless...Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch \ud83d\ude02Strap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..But still good for the price..Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kAnymore and it is not worth the priceRealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kConsCall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is oneSteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterBattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 daysBut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..,I write this review after 1 week of using this watch, BP, BPM, SPO2 running and sleep tracking functions are working well, watch speaker is also loud and clear to you and the other callers. The only con is when you want to listen to songs through a watch from a mobile its Bluetooth disconnects automatically again and again, as this fund is not useful for me so ignore it, overall it's a good watch.,Everything is absolutely Greta in this smartwatch.But these things could have been better:. Watch faces- you should have the option to add upto 3-4 watch faces at once from the app rather than one at a time and 10 pre-installed ones. App ui could have been better. DND mode absent. No option to toggle Bluetooth (always on),Before review i would like to appreciate this great strategy to pour out honest reviews from users by giving them bookmyshow voucher.I loved the Touch Screen experience & Amoled screen of the watch, it gives a feel of premium watch. The band of the watch is average & doesn't look premium & i separately ordered a metal band. I am expecting Mobile App improvement from FireBoltt as I don't find it good enough if I compare it with Boat's App for its watches (As I own a Boat smartwatch). Rest Visionary is a good buy & worth the money the only thing which physically is not appealing is the average quality of the band.", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41r1d8a2WGL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Fire-Boltt-Smartwatch-Resolution-Connection-Assistance/dp/B0B3N7LR6K/ref=sr_1_38?qid=1672902996&s=computers&sr=1-38"}

It seemed interesting - and had something called DIRAC Opteo in it + ANC. So I thought I'd give it a shot.First-day impressions - it's blown me away!Exhaustive list of impressions:1. DIRAC OPTEO: Balanced sound with punchy bass! Yeah, and not booming bass. It's so great and I'm quite surprised it sounds like something you'd expect at a higher price point.  1.1 Soundstage: As soon as the headphone is switched on, it starts in 'battery saving mode'. Once you turn on DIRAC Opteo mode, you can literally feel the space opening up. All the instruments feel individual and sound separated. Fireflies (by Owl City) sounds lovely and all the strings sway in the centre while the various zaps and buzzes surround you. It's really great for the price!  1.2 Treble and Mids: Clean and clear. The bass doesn't overpower them and feels just right. The vocals come out clearly and all the instruments don't interfere with it (Drive home by Steven Wilson sounds great!).  1.3 Bass: Punchy and tight. I love how it fizzles in 'Bonfire' (by Knife Party) and how it reverberates in 'Turn Down for what' (by DJ Snake). 'Breakin' a Sweat'(by Skrillex, Zedd) sounded tight and I discovered how well produced it is! Lovers of tight bass, this is your product!2. Volume: It gets really loud. So loud that I can't listen to it at the highest setting. But if that's your thing, then you should know that the highs get pretty shrill at the setting, but the bass is still pretty clean and loud!3. ANC: ANC is present, but won't drown everything out. It's a great add on but if you're looking for a headphone to make all sounds around you zero, then this won't do that. If you need to drown out some noise while you listen to your tunes, this will do the trick!  3.1 Ambient Sound mode: The opposite of ANC, it pulls in the outside noise to let you have a conversation. Again, you can't blast tunes at high volume and still have a convo, but you can listen with lower volume (near 25% volume) and hear things around you. If the ambient sound also increased as I increased volume, it would have been amazing.4. Calling: Did a couple of calls. With no-noise, the other person said I sounded great! I took a couple of calls in a local grocery store (was pretty loud) and the other end had no issue hearing me.5. Buttons: The button placement is easy and I didn't feel any issue getting used to the controls. The simple manual explains everything in 2 mins, so read once and you're good to go.  5.1 To note: The sound is best in DIRAC Opteo mode. Every time you turn it on, you have to double press the multi function button to turn it on. I'd have loved having it on by default. Also every time I turn it on, it plays a 3-4 second tune, which could have been shorter. (Imagine hearing it every time you turn the thing on. Ugh.)6. Connectivity: Once I connected it to my phone the first time, it connects to my phone within 1-2 seconds of turning the earphones on.7. Battery: It seems to last long! I've been using them for about 4.5 hrs and it's gone down about 20%. Cannot say anything more yet though.  7.1 When you take both the earphones out of your ears, it doesn't auto pause like some of the competitors. Annoyed that this was missed, would have saved so much more battery if they did this.8. Build quality: I have a black version. It's made with good quality plastic and didn't feel heavy around my neck. It doesn't have metal anywhere, and it's quite simple. I think it looks decent.9. Exercise: Need to test! Will update later.In summary, an easy recommendation. If you can overlook the small issues, there's a great sounding, feature-packed and long lasting device here at a great price! 10/10 would definetely recommend!,First I was bit sceptical about the build quality but have to say it's got a pretty sturdy material and decent quality buttons, bass is good, vocals are much clearer in Crystal bionic mode, ANC is working to a degree will definitely cancel out the noise of your celing fan but don't except any more than that, no issues with call enx is working upto it's name, battery is sufficient around 12-14 hours if you mix up the modes.. Overall a decent all rounded neckband, jack of all and king of none.,All other things such as sound quality, battery backup are very good but multiple device pairing is implemented very poorly. If I connect with laptop and try to connect with phone at same time. It does not work many times. If headphones are connected to laptop and you close the laptop without shutting it down then you won't be able to connect with phone again unless and until you disconnect with laptop. This is a big bug. Please fix this.,This BoAt 330 ANC Neckband is very Good but needs improvement and fixes.Pros:-\u2022 Nice Sound Quality while using Crystal Bionic Sound, but it's average on normal mode which feels a little more bassy and losses clarity at certain points.\u2022 Great Build Quality\u2022 It's ANC & Ambience mode is good in this price range.\u2022 It's quite Comfortable to wear for long sessions as per my ear fitting.\u2022 It has Dual Pairing which is very good but it's not very seamless and there is a small issue with dual pairing, e.g., while receiving a call on one device, the audio/video being played at another device won't Pause (you have to manually pause) instead there won't be any sound output through that device. Its a little issue but it would have been great if the video gets paused while receiving a call on another device, as this is available on BoAt Rockerz 335 and a few different BoAt Neckbands.Cons:-\u2022 It's range is very low considering Bluetooth v5.2, I even have BoAt neckband with v5.0 which has better range. Even a single wall coming in between 3-4ms can block the sound output.\u2022 Its battery life is average which needs charge every day if you use it for roughly 8-10 hours everyday with Bionic Crystal Mode/ANC enabled.\u2022 While using Dual Pairing sometimes there are sound drops and lags in between. And the sound gets high pitched and starts lagging sometimes if you switch quickly between devices. (This happened on the Replacement unit I received, maybe it's not the case with your unit).\u2022 Sometimes no sound is received while playing Audio from both devices. (I don't know if it's wrong with my unit or every unit.)Overall this is a good and considerable Neckband under 2k if you want Good Bass-Rich Sound Quality, ANC/Ambience mode and Descent battery life.But if your requirements mostly is Dual Pairing, then this is not for you. As I bought this considering Dual Pairing feature most importantly. But it's not really seamless in between Devices, but still it's the best possible available feature in this price range or even under 5k but it needs improvements and fixes to make it more seamless and efficient.Another problem with Dual Pairing is that the media doesn't gets paused on first device if there's a call on the second one, which is already there on BoAt's few other Neckbands, but then there is no Media-Pause feature on them. (e.g., If audio is being played on 2 devices first device Audio will get paused if Audio is played on second device and vice-versa).So do try it out by yourself. Because it's my personal experience with the Neckband, maybe you get a better experience.Thanks for Reading. Happy Shopping!,Bought this one after using Rockerz 255 pro for over 2 years now. Comparing this with that, that one was ergonomically better, felt snug in ears.Standalone review of this.1. Noise Cancellation is just alright, not too great, not too bad.2. Sound Quality is definitely great and excellent with the Bionic Sound feature. Kudos on that part.3. Bass Quality is fairly good at this price point.4. Holds charge for as long as advertised.5.

Now right earbud gets discharged in hour and a half, whereas left one keeps going, so reducing one star. Will contact them for replacement and update here.Update 2: Called service center, they asked to bring it, but am lazy. I expected they'd replace at home. Paid more attention towards the issue above. The stable situation is that just after full charge, right bud can go upto 4 hrs, but left one always goes for 30-60mins more, and the difference is more if there is a standby of a day or two (when the left one loses juice rapidly it seems), so I guess I can still use the buds but with certain restrictions :) Will happily restore 5 stars if the issue stays stable for next 3 months.--------------Update after 6 months--------------No change in quality, still the pack charges the buds like a boss. During this period, they were once kept in mouth by my infant nephew for over half an hour (very dangerous, thankfully he couldn't swallow them!), full of saliva and whatnot, and on another occasion I threw one of my earbuds on the floor with full force (undisclosed depressing reason) due to which the touch panel with the logo got detached, which I then re-attached. After all this, buds are still rocking with same sound quality as on day 1. I think these are pretty darn sweet deals! Lack of volume control, etc. etc. is all forgiven. Happy customer. Although the issue of left earbud discharging earlier than right persists.-------------------Original review-------------------Using for last 2 months.I am an audiophile and also an instrumentalist. But I hadn't used any tws yet, so wanted to dip my toes and didn't want to invest much, but also not something throwaway. So settled for boult (no boat etc. due to their highly adultered sound signature), since I have previous experience with it. I like my music flat at studio quality. More recently, I've been using a low cost headphones with mindblowing performance: oneodio pro50. Go ahead and search it. It is really one of a gem for all those purist sound fans.Coming to this tws.Connectivity. Right out of the box, only left one was working after connecting to my iphone. Maybe right one didn't pair correctly to left. Did that reset thing as suggested (which also took some effort), but after that, both started working and since then, no issues. I am using both my phone and laptop (linux). Ofcourse you need to disconnect one to use another. But perfect connectivity now. I can move around in my 1300 sqft apt and no connection loss, which is great.Call quality is decent, faced no disconnects yet, and the other party is also ok with my voice, but you cannot talk in a hushed voice, you always need to speak up in a medium volume to let the other party understand you.Features. Tapping is oddly sensitive, I mean it responds even if I am adjusting the bud, and not touching the central area, but surprisingly takes a decent tap punch to play/pause. I can get used to that though. One thing, track aage peeche is ok. But these don't have anything which can control the volume. Bummed on that.Battery. Decent backup. It's been nearly 2 months. I use buds on an average of 2-3 hours daily, and I just had to charge the main case just 3-4 times. In an emergency I also used it to charge my iphone which it did really quickly. I was happy to see that. One weird thing to notice is that the right earbud always discharges more quickly than the left, infact I can use the left one 20-30 mins more that the right. But anyways, I put them both in the case once any one of them starts to complain of low battery.Sound quality.Bass frequencies: Very decent bass. Surprisingly great low bass (songs like 'the humma song', 'i wanna love you' sound pretty good), but a bit lacking in other frequencies of bass ('lut gaye' by Jubin doesn't sound that punchy as it should for a flat signature). Overall for the most part, you should be fine.Other frequencies: I'll review this from vantage point of studio quality signature. For mids, the spectrum is tilted towards bit of high bass (but surprising absence of very specific high bass frequencies as mentioned above), but its bearable. For highs, initially I felt the presence [a bit] lacking, which takes away that warmth and fidelity from a few tracks, but after using it for a few days, I started feeling alright in that aspect, maybe some burn in? God knows. Also remembering that I paid just 1800 bucks for these! I mostly will be using these while my walking and workout sessions, so I think my mind won't be nitpicking then. I'll soon be upgrading though.Overall, really a very decent purchase with good sound quality provided you can get these for under 2k. Cheers!,Hey.  .This one item has a built quality is like a stone..and also the working condition and sound quality it is marvelous, but only one problem is the noise cancellation that not working properly which means when we are in a crowded area while recording something or a call to another person the unwanted noises are coming they cannot hear properly our voice that's the only disadvantage on this one..,Right buds not performs well, I am trying to change music to next but it still plays the same which should not happen according to manual,Been using these for a month now. Can't massively complain, the sound quality is decent enough (may not be good enough for big music heads, not enough bass) and provides good noise isolation. Very impressed by the battery life with the charging case, and I use it every day. If you can snag it on a deal for ~1500 bucks it's a fantastic deal.,My only issue is,  we can't change the connection to 2 devices by 1 click.  Every thing else is fine.,Best at price. and require some button for operation.,call pick up /rejection function, next song play function not working on single touch,Product is good but battery not as expected", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41vEB+mY55L._SY300_SX300_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Boult-Audio-PowerBuds-Wireless-Waterproof/dp/B08D11DZ2W/ref=sr_1_69?qid=1672902997&s=computers&sr=1-69"}
