They are saying that rod is not under warranty. Only Box is under warranty. Maharaja is a cheater company.,The concern first,base of the heater is made of plastic and plastic base needs to be screwed with the metallic heater body with 2 screws. Since heater body is metallic, tall and has weight, the connection with plastic base doesn't feel robust/durable enough as it shakes when touched.Else all looks good and rest depends on how long it lasts.,The stand needs to be more sturdy as it leans back on flat surface.

Unfortunately this product doesn't have that option and my purchase went for a complete waste.,First things firstIt's not bad heater and it provides plenty of warmth.However, the unit I received had one major, or rather fatal, issue. Current was passing through its entire body, be it the front grill or the area near the handle in the back. You can't hold it without getting an electric shock when it's running. If you have to turn the knob or simply move it from one position to another, you would need to unplug it from the power source first. Otherwise it can be fatal. If you use it in the night, you have to keep it out of your reach otherwise if you wake up at night to drinking water or anything else, you might accidentally touch it and die. Homes with children needs to be extra protective.Now I am not sure whether this fault is only in my unit or a general problem with these type of heaters. I have requested a replacement, let's see how the replacement unit works. I'll update the review accordingly.,in my heater one rod is not working then i call the bajaj customer care number it is given in pamphlet then a person came from bajaj and my issue solved", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41WyoT08raL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Bajaj-Delux-2000-Watt-Room-Heater/dp/B009P2LK80/ref=sr_1_103?qid=1672923596&s=kitchen&sr=1-103"}

An oil heater is best that you can buy, but that is worth spending for places where the weather will be colder for more than 3 months and well below 10 deg. For normal winter uses, I recommend buying Convection type heaters with fan and Thermostat. Please avoid conduction based ones (They can consume less power, cheap but they are very slow, plus burns oxygen). Also note, whichever you buy make sure it has a Thermostat setting!Product Review:~~~~~~~~~~~~~This product from USHA is a convection type room heater, and I have listed the below features and information.\u2666 Twin Blade fan\u2666 Thermostat built-in (Like AC, will turn on/off as per temp changes)\u2666 1000W/2000W operation (2000W means faster heating)\u2666 Fan only mode for normal table fan type! (Can't adjust speed/ ON-OFF)\u2666 Power LED when it operates\u2666 Fan noise is high and a bit annoying if your room is very calm\u2666 15A Power plug and 1m cord length\u2666 Retracting stand to elevate height about 2 inches\u2666 1 year warranty for the productThe room heater uses a powerful fan to spread the heat. No Swing option, very directional. You must position it correctly and securely. The Thermostat option is good to have, and I suggest buyers to buy with thermostat, as this will help reduce your EB bills, as well as give comfortable weather inside. The thermostat is not very accurate, like in Air conditioners but works. The user manual gives clear information about using it.How to set up?~~~~~~~~~~~\u2660 Power on, select 1000w/2000w (The switch is not easy to operate)\u2660 Set to thermostat switch to MAX (Anti-clockwise)\u2660 Let the heater run till you feel comfortable (Warm inside)\u2660 Reduce the thermostat slowly till the point where the unit turns off\u2660 Leave that setting undisturbed and let the heater ON till morning--> Note, if you have mistakenly set it wrongly, turn-off and turn-on. Once again follow the same step above.I use this for my sleeping room which is about 12x12 size. In Bangalore, it is about 20-21 deg at night and can drop low in another few weeks, and it took about 20-30 minutes to bring it 26-27 deg with 1000w in almost closed room. Please note, if your place has a room temperature (Not outside temp) well below and it not exposed to sunlight, then it will take a long time to reach comfortable temperature. In such cases only use 2000 W setting. It does not burn oxygen but reduces relative humidity which can cause dryness, so keeping a bucket or a better a tray of water will help. But you must keep your window slightly open, never use it on a closed room.5A or 15A?~~~~~~~~I see this as a main problem, as in many of our houses, we only have 15A for Washing machines and AC socket which is not easily reachable. This unit can only be plugged into 15A socket. The reason is, when you operate a 230v, unit with 5A socket, you can only draw a maximum of 1150 Watts (230v x 5A) from that socket. However, since this unit operates also at 2000W, it requires 15A, as that could only provide up to ~3000W (230v x 15A) like ACs, etc. However, you can safely use this unit from a normal 5A socket ONLY IF YOU ARE USING AT 1000W ALWAYS. Just buy a 5A to 15A converter socket and use this. Do not worry, it will work just fine, but never use 2000W though (If you house has MCB Tripper, then it's much safe).Tips:~~~~>> Always keep some space from all 4 sides of the heater unit>> First try with fan unit for 10 minutes before using for heater (Using after a long storage )>> Keep a window slightly open for fresh air>> Air can feel dry after sometime, can cause nose irritation and dryness. Room must be ventilated, adding water tray can helpDrawbacks:~~~~~~~~1. Fan noise, sometimes unbearable in a calm room2. Average Build quality and finishingFinal words:~~~~~~~~~I recommend this product, a cheap and effective unit for a small to medium size rooms and it does not burn oxygen, but makes dry air which can easily be overcome. The prices could drop around 1700/- sometimes, so please check price before buying. Thanks for reading this, if you have any doubts, comment below.,On first Day , I had faced some minor problem in this product but day after that day till now it working with no minor and major issues. I am happy on this product \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude0a.,Good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GxDSyE-yL._SY88.jpg,Hi,I purchased this Usha 812T heater which got delivered to me on 29th Dec 21. We use it moderately for just 3-4 hrs in day.It was working fine for 18 days. However,on 19th day i.e on 16Jan22 night, after around half an hour of running it suddenly started making 'khad,khad,khad...' sound and all its coil were red hot. Since we were awake, I just switched off the power from main switch. It could have resulted into burning or fire, if I would have delayed for few more seconds.When I picked up the heater in hand, it looked some part was loosened inside.Then on the next day, on 17th Jan 22, I lodged a complaint with Usha customer care, na di was told the technician will visit within 48hrs. However, no one came in 48 hrs. So I called up the technician on the number shared to me by Usha on 19th. After that technician visited me. Upon checking he found that out of 2 fans, one fan has loosened completely and fallen inside, that is why it was making sound and coils were getting too much heated.I was relaxed that it's not a big problem and would be fixed quickly. But to my surprise, the plastic coupler to which the fan was screwed, is not able to hold the screw tightly. There was a problem with the coupler. What kind of quality it is that within few days of usage screw automatically loosenrd and coupler not able to hold it anymore?Adding to my surprise, the technician was not having the new coupler for replacement. He said he will check tomorrow and come back of part is available. But he didn't came back. When I called next day, he said part is not available and has informed the company, but can't say when it will be available.So I called Usha customer care again, and they said \"yes techinician has reported part is not available\" na dwe are forwarding your request to service team to arrange the part asap.Since then I have been calling Usha Customer care as well techinician everyday and both are throwing the ball on each other.Usha customer care is worst saying everytime that they are forwarding the request to concerned department and as soon as the part is available it will be replaced. I asked them how many days it may take as I can't keep on waiting for a month, they just said they can't say when it would be available.Since it is too cold nowadays, and heater is not working what is the use of purchasing this Usha heater.If they will replace it after a month, winter would have already passed by then.This is a worst after sale service from big brand like Usha, and it was not expected from Usha. If they don't have the basic parts available with the service center, what is the use of sending technician empty handed?From now on, I will never recommend Usha to anyone, and if any Usha representative is reading this post, I request to them to service my heater asap.Thanks,Go ahead \ud83e\udd29,The cord is very short and required 16 amp plug point.

Room was closed.I retirmed it. Bought Black+Decker 11 fin which is too fast and surpass this bajaj 13fin.,Bajaj name in itself a guarantee of excellence. A very product. Heats up the house in no time. Like a boon to elderly people like us,This is my review after 3 days of usage. Firstly I feel I got a used product as the packing was already unpacked inside the box and normally with a brand new unused oil heater, on first usage you get a smell as the oil and fins heat up for first time. This did not happen for me. Anyways I just thought to see if all is good and hope it performs.The heater has very very slow heating. You need to run it at max thermostat and with full load 2500 or 2900 W and even then it will take very long to feel the warmth. I was able to touch the fins for a second even after operating it for more than an hour without cutting off. Thermostat cut off works but quite below max and then it wont heat up as it gets cut off and on.For such type of heater the room should have just one entry and that should not keep opening often. If you have doors opening every now and then, it will not keep room warm.Over all for the price it has I didn't feel like its worth to operate it when it has so slow heating.,This clearly is one of the best oil heater out there at a very good price. In offline i was getting 13 fin model for 12k to 13k, but here at Amazon i got it at Rs. 9799. This is very silent and heats up the room in 20 to 30 min.,Really worth for the money spent. Easy to use and can be moved to other rooms without any difficulty. The performance is good.,The product is good but the desired product was not delivered,I am happy with my decision to buy this heater. Room gets warm and comfy .,The radiator works very well even in the cold Kullu weather. Has 2 heat settings and when you\u2019ve turned it on for a while, you can turn the heat settings off and the fan will still blow warm air. Very effective and doesn\u2019t give you headache like the rod heaters do. Has auto cutoff as well.", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41PhEVR4X4L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Bajaj-Majesty-Filled-Radiator-Heater/dp/B01N1XVVLC/ref=sr_1_125?qid=1672923597&s=kitchen&sr=1-125"}

The base and the bottle dont seem to fit exactly so that the entire contraction wobbles about when the water starts boiling.

But these are all made in China anyway. i have nothing against China, here with the Wipro kettle there seems to have been a bad lot which possibly explains why the price is lower than that of other models offered by Wipro.This is a problem with shopping on Amazon that one gets sucked into price comparisons and going for the cheaper option which are mostly defective products without any disclaimer.

Device has high suction power and can be cleaned easily with a bagless design where dust collects in a chamber, and you can empty it in the dustbin\u2014no hassles of cleaning and replacing bags.2. Components are high quality, such as the telescopic extension is metallic, though it's also a con for this attachment. Even plastic components are of good quality.3. Device easily moves around owing to its big and smooth wheels. You don't need to pull it by force.4. Default flexible pipe itself is long and has an integrated brush that can also be retracted. Its a highly useful attachment considering it's attached to a primary flexible pipe and is easily available for use.5. Each attachment here is multipurpose. When you open the package, you feel like very few attachments are provided, but when you start exploring, you discover that all attachments are multipurpose. (details below)6. Attachments are easy snap fit and remove (ActiveLock in the company's terminology). Once you insert the attachments, it click locks and can be removed by a press of a button or release lever.7. Both the turbo brush and multi-nozzle have flexible neck and wheels on the bottom for easy movement and effective cleaning8. Dust collector can be opened with one press and has removable filters attached to it. These filters can be washed once in a while to prevent clogging.9. the Main unit has H13 filter system to filter fine dust, dust mites, etc., and is equivalent to HEPA 13, as per the company. This filter is accessible from the backside for cleaning purposes.10. Device obviously makes sound but is not in the range of causing irritation to the ears.

Telescopic extension is metallic and heavy. So, it's a bit of trouble to use for longer durations, especially when you are trying to clean ceilings.2. Reduction of suction power is via a bypass valve built into the flexible pipe and has no way to reduce the power of the machine to reduce suction. So effectively, this valve makes cleaner suck in air from in between to reduce suction at the end, but then consumes the same amount of power. If there had been a control mechanism to reduce power, it would also save electricity.3. Device comes with a 16amp top but its 2-pin, so if you are going to use it with modular power sockets with self closing mechanism for holes, it will be a trouble to plug it in everytime.4. I miss the blower system in this cleaner, which is handy at times (was there in my previous cleaner). They could have easily implemented it.For the cons reducing 1 star, but its definitely a 4-star device.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\ud83d\udd27 Attachments\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022- Flexbile pipe comes with an integrated brush, and you can easily retract it back onto the pipe- Multipurpose nozzle has a button to increase its suction power, and with one press, it goes nearer to the floor- Turbo brush nozzle sweeps the floor or mattress with rotating bristles along the length, and if you want to turn off the rotation of the brush, there is a button to lock it- Main unit has a system on the back and botton side to attach the multi-clean and turbo brush nozzle primarily for easy sweep or for storage purposes\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\ud83c\udfc6 FINAL VERDICT\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022This bagless vacuum cleaner is a hassle-free device and requires very less maintenance but it comes at a cost, and if you are willing to stretch your budget, it's definitely worth it. I have had no any issues so far in the past 1 year, when using it regularly.,This is a nice bag less vaccum cleaner with a rotating brush that does a great job of cleaning. It also comes with good set of accessories. I found it also cheaper to order it online compared to the \u2018Croma\u2019 store. Two drawbacks (not a deal breaker) I found and I hope Philips addresses them were,1. It comes with a two pin 15 ampere plug and you need to buy an adapter to use with normal 5 ampere plugs in the house. I was afraid to use the adapter thinking that it may heat with the use but had no issues with heating of the adapter or the plugs in the wall during 15-20 minutes of cleaning each room in the house. I do not see a point in having that plug.2. During the use one just pulls it along but It has no handle to lift the machine. I believe that one can use the handle of the dust canister to lift the machine but I am afraid that repeated lifting like this will break the click-on mechanism so ended up lifting the machine as a whole all the time while moving the machine without the hose.As I mentioned earlier these are not deal breaker but enough to take one star off and can have the star back if Philips addresses the issues on this great little machine.,Suction power is good suitable for cleaning carpet , window curtains ,floors and carpets.Cleaning the dust container is also very easy. Only concern i have is, if some length power cord is not pulled out from machine, the power wire that still reamins inside the machine is getting heat from suction motor, after using the machine for nearly 1 hour and i pulled out the cord that was in the machine, it was actually liitle hot to touch not sure is it safe for the live power cord to warm up like this. would have been even better, if this had blower functionality also.,Good product,Cord length and Suction power is satisfactory,Good quality, heavy noise,This is the first vacuum cleaner purchase for me and I can say that I am a happy customer. I bought this back in August '22 and it is serving me well.
