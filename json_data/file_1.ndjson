I tried lubuntu 20 and ubuntu 22, it worked out of the box in both, didn't have to do any setup. There's an extender cable so you can place this in a comfortable place. Get the model with antenna because otherwise you'll have range problems if you're not directly in line of sight from your wifi router.,The wifi dongle is a simple plug & play device, will start catching available networks right after you plug it into your USB port, no additional installations/ softwares requires.

This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever.

Via HDMI cableAbout the Amazon installation service - Awful-------------------------------------------------------1. The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt. He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. However, it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2. I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws ( which I had bought ) with him. After about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. And for all this, he kept cussing me that I wasted his time. There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.This whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. This was the worst installation experience in my life so far.Bottomline - Please do not avail the 'so called free' installation service from Amazon. It is just a scam. Instead call the acer support. They will do the job much better.,After using it for 2 months, here are it's pros and cons:Pros :1. Great picture quality. It's awesome.2. Blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. Sound with 30db is very good4. Looks great with thin besel5. Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons.6. Content upscaling is very good.Cons:1. Remote could have been better. Can't use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. Remote operation is bit complex.3. Motion technology not great. There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT, but it decreases when you switch to DTH.Overall, it's a nice buy at this price point. I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. I am satisfied with the product.,Product has good picture quality. Good product at that price with 25w sound. Applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. It's running smoothly.,You get decent features for the price you pay. Screen resolution might be. Set back as you may find pixalation. Overall it's good,I am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (HD Ready) TV. It is truly an amazing panel. I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. However, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a stand.The remote is good, voice search works well for me. TV start up takes a long time in my opinion, but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls. Only negative aspect I faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. Firstly, the connection sometimes doesn't happen automatically after a  restart - which means I have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. Secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.However, I am still super happy with this TV. I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,At this price range(\u20b911499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.Picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).No major issues found on this TV.Just go for it.,Vellu for money.

I got it in the offer and it was totally worth it.Pros:-1. Sound is awesome - 100% satisfied with the quality of sound. Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV.2. Size and slim - It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4. Tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home.5. It gets integrated with mobile apps, remote, WiFi networks very quickly and easily.6. The overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic.7. It supports all the smart features like Netflix, Prime and YouTube. It is easily installable and sign-in to start using quickly.8. It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons:-1. Picture quality is 776p. It's average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I'll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don't have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality. This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but it's very good for daily family shows and TV channels.One last thing I want to express and I'm ver disappointed about is this.I got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday. But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.This is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon. I'm very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do? Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it's been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I'm having my smart TV delivered to my home, I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. Highly disappointed with this behavior and service.,Good product,Connectivity is faster,But performance is little bit slower,,The biggest problem I face is it don't have a aux cable so I'm not able to connect my sound bar......the HDMI port is useless it won't work .so,i connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it won't connect automatically, everytime I on the tv i need to connect it manually it's a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now it's been 4 months and it's super laggy .....even after the update its just the same.....yeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstanding......that's all,Good quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice. Budget friendly, I'm happy with this .,After a few days, the TV will perform slowly and the  remote  is very very sentence,thank you amazon and oneplus,1. Sound is good2. Easy installation3. very Slim and less weight4. Voice recognition is good,LikeBudget-friendlyDislikeWiFi connectivity range is poor.Many times gets disconnected.Color depth not that good.", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41WE9ZGEC4L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-inches-Ready-Android-32Y1/dp/B08B42LWKN/ref=sr_1_29?qid=1672909125&s=electronics&sr=1-29"}

Movies and especially hi-res TV series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times, the output, while in hi-res , wouldn't look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of Sony, Samsung LG etc however, with time, you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone else's better TV.Sound: Sound output is decent. You wouldn't need additional support to enhance the volume as such.Remote: Sleek, sensitive and user-friendly. It's exactly like Amazon's remote.OS: Same as any smart Android TV. Works smoothly without much lags or hiccups. Switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than Sony but unless you have used to of those performances, it looks just fine.Standalone and as your first smart TV,  you wouldn't find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hi-res from the beginning. It is a great value for money product without a doubt.However, if you are considering this as an alternative or second TV after owning the better ones in the past, you will have a hard time adjusting with it.,Picture quality is good for this price, didn\u2019t faced any lag on UI and browsing other apps. Only negative will be audio, definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher. Overall worth for money u spend. But the installation process is just awful, Amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals , just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money. No demo given on Tv as they have no idea about the product, these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through online.,Screen looks amazing but problem is with processor I believe. If 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickers(not so often but problem exists), even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user action.Reason why I believe processor is bad because I do 4k gaming using PS5 and never encountered problem with the screen.,If you buy TV in a small town shop, it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours. When you want to buy a TV from Amazon, you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable. The problem is with the installation, they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product. It\u2019s like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you can\u2019t eat. So I ordered my TV on Monday, it got delivered on Friday and it will be installed on Monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns. If we had the technician details, we could reach out  s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours before.Regarding product, it\u2019s good quality and very good for a average user. Heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging, I guess.,This TV gives good results within the budget, should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part.1) The installation guy didn\u2019t arrive at very first day that was scheduled, even after rescheduling he didn\u2019t came for installation purpose. So strictly be aware of this point.2) The TV I got in offer with 3k discount on ICICI card but although the product came out defective, it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time.3) Even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece I didn\u2019t got the replacement for the product and it\u2019s totally unfair deal by Amazon and the seller too.Final verdict is the TV quality and feature are good but the service from seller and Amazon that is got was very poor inspite I was prime member. The seller DAWNTECH ELECTRONICS PRIVATE LIMITED gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases Amazon will not help you. Thankyou,Team,Also to be added TV installation services with product while delivering and unboxing. NO need to other sub-vendor to getting installation and demo. Also dependency on third-party involvement should be less.Bad experience with TV installation stuff.Pls look into this .,Picture quality good. Sound quality  not upto my 3xpectations. Not able to find the real Dolby stereo effect. Remote not upto the mark.4 \u2b50 for picture quality, 3\u2b50 for both sound and remote quality,Good quality picture but it hangs on home screen", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hQfTroMzL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-50-inches-Android-Pro/dp/B0B3MMYHYW/ref=sr_1_42?qid=1672909125&s=electronics&sr=1-42"}

Here's a quick Fact for the User's complaining about the LESS cost to benefits ratio, guys if you buy a Android TV box alone which has processing capacity similar to this tv, then it would alone cost you more than 5K rupees & here you get this TV with that android setup with various other feature under 15K. So just check once, what options you have before complaining.Eventually I bought this TV, since I was already using 4A 43 version for months and wanted smaller version for bedroom. Now after using this TV for over 3 weeks, I am stating my DETAILED user experience. Its a detailed & huge review, but do read it, if you want to invest this much amount.\u25cf\u25cf If you want to get quick overview of the device, then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review \u25cf\u25cf# Firstly its budget friendly & ONLY Smart TV under 15k in the current market.# Has Most number of Output port ( 1*AV, 3*HDMI, 2*USB ).# Has Android 8.1 out of the box along with inbuilt Bluetooth# Has Dual interface - MI Patchwall & Android TV ( I mostly prefer android TV interface )# Remote has Bluetooth & Voice Search with sleek profile.# Has better processor compared to predecessor along with 1GB RAM + 8GB storage ( 4.7GB actual )# Speaker Output is low.# Need IR cable for using set top box with android interface.# Amazon prime & Netflix is NOT preloaded, but can be side loaded.# Native Display is ONLY HD, though 1080p & even 4K videos from youtube works well (check images attached).# Can install & play tons of High quality games like RR3, etc (check images attached).# Finally smartphone mirroring works fine most of the time.FULL DETAILED REVIEW :---->BUILT QUALITY :------------------# Has combination of plastic and aluminium for the main body. Its not great, but above average.# Table top stands looks bit flimsy, but are workable.* The screws which are provided in the box, DOES NOT fits the tv perfectly, so I bought new from local store.# It has averagely slim profile, not the slimmest in the market.# Speaker Placement is inconvenient. Since they are placed at the bottom, so when you keep it on table top, the sound tends to dampen and bulge.# Has good ventilation for electronics and it hardly heats up.# Overall built quality is above average.DISPLAY QUALITY :---------------------# It has very Thin bezels, which looks great.# Video resolution is 1366x768p, but 1080p videos works fine on it.* 4K videos on youtube runs smoothly as well.# Viewing angle are good compared to price. ( Check the images attached )# Contrast is above average, Brightness is good and colours are quite vivid.# Display quality is also above average, not very great.REMOTE CONTROL :-----------------------# Its very sleek and compact.# Has only 7 buttons and is easy to operate.# Fortunately it has Volume buttons, which is handy. ( I have couple of android TV boxes without volume button on remote, so I know the pain of using mouse to adjust the volume :P )# Placement of Voice search button is improper. Its just below Power button, and I end up pressing power button a lot.# Finally its bluetooth, so no need to point it towards tv for operation.OTHER FEATURES :---------------------# It has Dual interface, i.e. Patchwall and android TV.  Has tons of content.# Many games can be installed (till you have memory left), including multiplayer games.# Google voice search is very useful, if you don't want to use keyboard.# Processing speed is fast and I haven't detected any lags yet. ( Lags in streaming can be due to slow internet speed, not due to hardware )# Bluetooth and wifi connectivity works perfectly.CONS :------# Speaker output though rated 20W, is NOT upto the mark. My 16W JBL speakers has better and louder sound.# Placement of speaker is inconvenient, as in table top position, speakers face the table and sound dampens.# Internal Memory is very LESS.# NO Netflix and amazon prime pre loaded, though you can side load them.# Miracast not supported. Even normal smartphone mirroring lags sometimes.# Native resolution is just 720p HD, though the 1080p videos works on usb & 4K on youtube.# Screen is Slightly reflective, its similar to almost all the other LED tv's.# Mixed experiences of after sales service.CUSTOMER CARE :--------------------# Firstly the installation is a Joke. My installation was scheduled 16 days after my product Delivery and the fun part is, there's ONLY 10 days replacement window for this product :P# Company only takes replacement if the product is opened by their Representative, so there's NO point of return window time frame.# MI has mixed reviews for repairs and services. Though I have not encountered any problem with any MI tv yet, I have had issues with other mi products and service center near me is always very helpful.VERDICT :-----------Considering all the facts, if you are fine with above average Display quality, want a Smart tv and if you have tight budget, then this the TV you should certainly go for. Trust me, you won't get any better deal than this least for coming couple of months. If you have higher budget, then certainly explore brands like sony, samsung, etc.This is NOT a perfect smart TV, but for the given price and 2 Years of warranty, its NO brainer to choose this, its certainly worth the investment.,This television is definitely a perfect balance between price and performance especially during flash sale at an exceptional price of \u20b912500.Performance \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50-----------------------The processor in this Smart TV is powerful enough to play 4K 10bit HEVC videos right out of the box. VLC or MX player can be installed for enhanced media support.Picture Quality \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50--------------------------Many people complain about the overbright screen. But it can be compensated by adjusting the display settings.These are my preferred settings.Backlight :1 to 20*********************During night even the lowest value of 1 is  bright enough and can watch content without hurting eyes.During day time adjust it as per your requirement depending on your ambient lighting conditions. A maximum of 20 would be enough.Setting backlight to minimum improves black levels, reduces power consumption, increases LED life and reduces eye strain especially during night.Brightness :48*****************Brightness setting controls black level.Increasing brightness reduces black levels and hence reduces contrast.Brightness at 50, pictures looks washed out with poor blacks and color saturationAt 45 black looks deep but lots of details at dark areas are lost while watching movies.48 is an optimal setting to my eyes with good blacks and not so lack of details.Contrast : 40 to 45*********************Contrast setting controls white level.Contrast can be set anywhere between 40 and 45. Increasing contrast too much may cause highlight areas in a picture, like bright skies or shiny objects might look overexposed. As the screen itself is very bright, increasing contrast further makes whites look over bright. Also colors gets washed out while increasing contrast.Saturation: 45 to 50************************Color saturation can be set anywhere between 45 to 50. At 45 colors look more natural. At 50 colors looks a bit punchy. But still its a personal preference.At the above settings, the black levels and colors were pleasing while watching demo videos of OLED TVs on YouTube at 1080p . The following Youtube videos help you to check the black level quality of the TV.LG 4K OLED Beauty Of Black DemoLG OLED Eclipse 2 DemoLG HD Demo Art NouveauFull HD and 4K videos looks sharp in this TV. Downloaded a sample 4K HEVC video named 'Life Untouched' and also a 4K HEVC sample of the movie Elysium. Both of them played smoothly on the TV with very good details.Screen Quality \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50--------------------------I think this is a VA panel , the quality of which sits right in between TN and IPS panels. The screen is glossy and hence reflective. This might be a problem if the TV is placed in a room with windows facing it.Like all other LCD panels, this also has also got uneven screen uniformity but that's only noticed in plain dark grey backgrounds. While watching movies or other content it's not at all a problem. Screen non uniformity is a common issue even with high end TVs of big brands like LG Samsung etc.Luckily there's no backlight bleeding in the unit  I received.Viewing angles are average with some loss of contrast even at low angles but that's a common VA panel characteristic. IPS panels with good viewing angles can't be expected at this price point.All LCD panel technologies have their strengths and weaknesses. IPS panels have good viewing angles but has poor black levels. VA panels excels in black depth despite it's average viewing angles and this TV has got very impressive black levels.Sound Quality \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50--------------------------Bass is a bit weak (I think bass is improved following some updates. So giving 5 stars from 4.) It's very loud even at low volume. Midrange and treble are very good. Even minute high pitched click and tick sounds in movies can be heard very clearly.Edit:In a previous review I have mentioned these EQ settings sounds good. But it isn't.100Hz : 7300Hz : 81000Hz : 43500 Hz : 610000 Hz : 5A high value of 8 for 300 Hz actually make the sound muddy and muffled.The following settings sounds much better and here's the reason.100 Hz : 8 - BassFrequency setting for deep bass male vocals and instruments like Kick Drum,Toms, Snare etc.300 Hz : 4 - Low MidrangeEnhances bass and depth of male vocals. Increasing 300Hz too much makes sounds muddy and muffled reducing clarity of high frequency sounds1000 Hz : 3 - MidrangeImparts a metallic tone. Increasing makes sound tinny and unpleasant.3500 Hz : 5 - Upper MidrangeVocals especially female sounds best at this frequency. A value of 5 enhances vocal quality. Increasing too much makes vocals harsh.10000 Hz : 7 -TrebleAdds crispiness and sparkle to vocals and instruments. Enhances tinkling  sounds of metallic  instruments.Human ear is sensitive to midrange and upper midrange frequencies Here it's 1000 and 3500 Hz. Setting these values too high can cause listening fatigue. Even increasing 300Hz is disturbing.Great sound performance especially bass is not even expected from a television in this budget. But considering its midrange frequency, clear treble and loudness, it deserves 4 stars.Remote Control \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50-----------------------------Minimalism is great. But minimalism with less functionality is not so great. Addition ofMute,TV Settings and Video input selection buttons would 've made the remote more functional.App support \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50(Update)-----------------------When the TV was released there was no support for Netflix and Amazon Prime. But now with Pie update it supports both Netflix and Amazon Prime. Now the TV deserves 5 stars for app support.Pros and Cons--------------------------- Pros:1. Powerful processor for 4K media playback.2. App installation via USB3. Built in Chromecast4. Bluetooth remote5. Voice CommandCons: (Update)Previously the main issues with the TV were the lack of Autoplay function and Standby option.But in the latest update both these issues are solved.Now when the TV is turned on it will automatically go to the previous Input sourceTo enable it, go to Settngs >Inputs > Enable 'Stay on the previous source' option.Screen off feature is also added in the new update. Long pressing Power button will show Screen Off option.The only disadvantage left on the TV was lack of Miracast. But on a latest update build PI.4316 miracast is included and now its perfect.To sum up:--------------------Overall considering the picture quality, powerful hardware and the price, the TV definitely deserve 5 stars devoid of it's average audio quality and the glossy screen because there are no other TVs in market with such features at this price point. Also Xiaomi now has got very strong service support across India.New brands like iFFalcon, Blaupunkt ,Thomson etc might provide better options at a competitive price. But when it comes to service centres, it's a dead end.I am very much satisfied with the purchase.,It's good product,Good,if you like a best tv on your budget I'll recommend you this stunning picture quality and DTS surround is osm but there was a few lagging problem and Miracast is not good \ud83d\ude41,Build quality good.sound and bass excellent.,Product is very good. Sound quality is crisp. Worth buying. I brought it 2 years back. Still working fine,Good quality", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41nsy8kxWUL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/inches-Full-Android-L43M6-INC-Black/dp/B09JPC82QC/ref=sr_1_45?qid=1672909125&s=electronics&sr=1-45"}

Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn\u2019t an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn\u2019t bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger\u2019s seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it\u2019s cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can\u2019t be termed as thin or delicate too. It\u2019s not the thickest I\u2019ve seen but then thickest doesn\u2019t always means most durable. Given my application it\u2019s more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct 2017 & it was imported to India in Dec 2017.10.) The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) A customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received & been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. Make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D, without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,Amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.As an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesn't also disappoint,Supports fast charging for all my Samsung phones.I use Samsung a9pro 2016, Samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .Very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftVery affordable pricing. Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung s20fe.,Super,Product charging is ok.. however it's mere 1 foot in length..  the vendor could have mentioned  correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as I have received it today.,Good,I have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs 50 and Rs 100 of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.Finall i decided to go for this.And it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice : Dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.You will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.Better buy this one.", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/31nrDWDT8+L._SX300_SY300_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/AmazonBasics-Micro-Charging-Android-Phones/dp/B07232M876/ref=sr_1_53?qid=1672909126&s=electronics&sr=1-53"}
