It was easy to setup as a extender . Signal is also good but not that great. It can cover 1 flat well . Signal breaks if moving upstairs or downstairs. Overall great purchase. Must buy,Need little better customer support,good,I expected much stronger signal 10 meter away. Its okay working, but not as expected.,tp link is good product,Good product,Decided on buying this Router from TP-Link after days of research, reading reviews and talking to many people regarding different models.Was on a 20 Mbps connection with a Netgear N300 router since 2016 which used to suffice for moderate usage till now. However, with increase in the number of devices like Smart TV, 2 iPads and a laptop etc, it necessitated an upgrade. Also, considering the current work-from-home scenario which is bound to continue for the foreseeable future as well, the internet usage was being stretched to it's limit and the trusted Netgear router simply couldn't match up to the increased bandwidth demand.To capitalise on the current situation, our current ISP came out with interesting Fibre broadband plans and we opted for a 75 mbps connection. That in turn needed a new router to utilize it's optimum potential. Finally zeroed in on the TP-Link Archer C80 after reading some horror stories of other available routers. Was also tempted to buy the AX1500 considering there's barely any price difference, but then came across a few reviews which stated that Wifi 6 is not entirely successfully implemented and might prove to be an hindrance to use with our current range of devices.Order delivered by Amazon within a day. Full marks for the seamless delivery as always. Prime has truly been a boon.Installed the Router today. Installation via Tether App was seamless. ISP guy helped with the PPPOE sign-in process and released the MAC ID which was bound to our old Router. The whole process was done in 10 mins and we were online.The dual bands are truly a boon. Have divided the devices at home equally between 2.4G and 5G as per usage. As the router is close to the TV unit, have connected it to 5G and also alternatively connected via the Ethernet cable (just in case).Speed tests:Started off by streaming 4k content simultaneously on 2 devices connected to 5G. Played seamlessly even with other devices like mobiles etc being connected.Have attached a few pictures for reference.- Sitting near the Router, 5G Download speed is 77 mbps and Upload is 75.4 mbps.- 5G speed tested in the bedroom with a wall in between: Download 72.4 mbps and Upload 74.9 mbps.- 2.4G speed in the same room as the Router is: Download 68.3 mbps and Upload 79.2 mbps. (This is quite surprising as a few reviews mentioned 50-55 mbps will be the threshold for 2.4G. Used to get a maximum of 45 mbps download on my old N300).- Speed Test via the Ethernet cable provided in thr box connected to the TV: Download 78 mbps and Upload 75 mbps.Couldn't have asked for more really. This seems to be totally ideal.Build quality of the device is decent and the antennas seem well enough to do the job, however would have preferred that they were placed like other TP-Link models like the Archer A6, so it would have been easier to move them in preferred directions.The LED lights are a little weirdly placed and not bright enough. Maybe I'm used to the prominent lights on my old Router. These are a blink-and-miss sort and you have to bend a little to check in case there's an issue. One big element missing in this device is a USB port which is absolutely essential in today's age and expected to be included for this price range. Wonder what's the reason behind giving it a miss.I have sealed the extra LAN ports with tape to protect from dust or moisture. It's a good practice. The outer design of the router is quite sophisticated and stylish, however I'm a little worried of dust accumulating in the intricate design on the top portion.Functionally though, this seems to be a real good offering from TP-Link. Hope this device lives up to expectations in coming days. All-in-all, seems to be a worthy investment for the next few years, considering an internet plan upgrade, if any.Hope I touched upon major points which might help other interested consumers in making a choice. This product is RECOMMENDED! :)", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41c7bJo7ooL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/TP-Link-Archer-C20-Wireless-Router/dp/B0759QMF85/ref=sr_1_187?qid=1672903004&s=computers&sr=1-187"}

With an overall positive impression of Logitech's performance (compared to my experience with similar from Dell, HP) - I decided to try the slightly cheaper and compact MK215.While I knew this would be more compact, with fewer keys - I feel I should highlight the disadvantages I can see immediately (especially for users of full-size keyboards at work - refer image)1. While my hands will get used to closer keys - they also seem much less \"springy\" (lower). Overall size is also too small to place on one's lap and type, which I could with the other wireless keyboard, especially during WFH.2. Big point is the MUCH larger size of the dongle. This will need to be removed and stashed carefully at home every time I throw my laptop into my bag for a meeting. I never did this for MK270 and simply kept dongle fixed forever to my laptop USB port. That dongle also had a slot inside the mouse for safekeeping, which is not there in MK215.3. Neither mouse nor keyboard has a switch off - MK270 had switch on both. MK215 mouse takes 2 AA, whereas MK270 takes 1 battery.4. Mouse is shaped different - lower arch and wider - which may simply take adjusting. Feels a little cheaper.While a real review can only be provided much later - seeing how keys/clicks perform over the long run (and one hopes that Logitech will have taken care of that quality) - while I don't have any complaints so far, I feel paying a bit extra for the MK270 may suit many folks out there. Hope the review helps - will update later if I see find any fundamental issues with time.,Product is good but lagging very much.Not enjoying/ satisfied with this product.Bad  for me\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude14.,It is working fine till now.,The keyboard is good but pretty small when compared with regular keyboards.

I switched the USB receiver to another USB port on other side of laptop without any neighboring ports.

The information provided below is as per the manufacturer.\uf0a7 Boat BassHeads 225 have a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz.\uf0a7 It Features 10 mm drivers.\uf0a7 Rated Impedance of 16 ohms.\uf0a7 Comes with 1.2 meter Flat Tangle Free Cable.\uf0a7 3.5 mm Gold-Plated L-Shaped Audio Jack (90 degrees).\uf0a7 Sensitivity : 98 dB+/-3 dB.____________________Built Quality & Design---------------------------------I was not expecting metal built at this price range but to my surprise, Boat BassHeads 225 are fully made up of metal. It has a diagonal grid-like texture on the buds which feels amazing on touch. The metal construction gives Boat BassHeads 225 a premium feel & attractive appearance. The cable used by Boat on BassHeads 225 is Flat with rubberized coating, it is a tangle-free cable & does it's job well by decreasing the chances of the cable tangling. Despite the metal construction, Boat BassHeads 225 are very lightweight & comes with a microphone & L-Shaped 3.5 mm audio jack which is again made up of metal. Overall the built quality is excellent for the price & seems very durable. The ear buds have proper L & R labels and are clearly visible. Boat BassHeads 225 comes with medium sized silicone tips already installed out-of-the-box.___________Audio Quality-------------------To ensure that I can test the BassHeads 225 at their uppermost limit, I used high-quality MP3 files of 320 kbps & Lossless audio formats like FLAC & WAV. For smartphone listening, I used Poweramp music player & tweaked settings every now and then to see their extreme capability. For the computer, I used iTunes player & VLC Audio player. I also tested these earphones on Apple iPod, iPhone & Sony MP3 Player. All this went for more than 10 days & finally, I had my results.Boat BassHeads 225 promised what they claimed, they really are very bassy as compared to others. During my tests with them, I found that the audio quality is very good for the price, the bass output is amazing and overpowers the vocals by default, by tweaking the equalizer settings a bit, I saw a good level of improvement in the vocals, they were clearer than before but overall average. The treble was again very good, the high-frequency sounds were clear & pleasant to ears. The mids were average but overall the audio experience on Boat BassHeads 225 was decent. When listening to music, the overall sound quality is amazing, you can easily distinguish between different instruments & sounds which is a good thing for extra bassy headphones.______________________Noise Isolation & Comfort-------------------------------------When it comes to Noise Isolation, Boat BassHeads 225 are very good at it, They come with medium sized ear tip pre-installed which seemed perfect for my ears, once the earphones are on, I wasn't able to hear outside noise, they sealed my ears completely & delivered an immersive experience. Make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation & comfort. Overall Boat BassHeads 225 are comfortable but they seem a bit stiff & somewhat awkward when used for longer periods. Since the housing is made up of metal, you may find them popping out every now & then when used during running, jogging or any other sport or physical activity, this didn't happen as often for me but for a friend, they keep popping out every now & then while running (maybe the shape of ears has something to do with it), An easy solution to this will be using the Ear Hooks which came along with it. When using BassHeads 225 with Ear Hooks, they were a bit uncomfortable initially, but as I got used to them, they were fine, plus this stopped popping issue since the hooks keep a hold on them.-----------------------------------------Flat Cable & Microphone-----------------------------------------The cable is great, I personally prefer flat cables and this earphone come with a perfect flat cable which is tangle free & comes with a rubberized coating. The cable does its job well. The microphone is again exceptionally good, it records voice with clarity with less to no disturbance or background noise. During calls, the person on the other end can clearly hear the voice with no background disturbance. There is one button on the microphone which helps to pick up/reject calls on the go, without taking your phone out. It can also be used to control music, which is again a good to see in a budget friendly earphone like Boat BassHeads 225.____________________Warranty & Price---------------------------------Boat BassHeads 225 comes with standard One Year Warranty, so make sure you keep the purchase invoice safe, in case you need it for warranty._____________Final Thoughts!----------------------I've personally used Boat BassHeads 225 In-Ear Headphones for more than two weeks (average daily two hours of listening) before writing this review and I'm pretty much impressed with them. I'm personally a fan of Extra Bass IEM's and currently, my primary IEM is Sony MDR-XB50AP which again falls under Extra Bass category. Comparing Sony MDR-XB50AP with Boat BassHeads 225 will be unfair since there is a big price difference between both of them, but I would still like to add that BassHeads 225 did a great job and didn't disappoint me, obviously it doesn't stand a chance in front of Sony MDR-XB50AP but still looking at the price of BassHeads 225 & the quality they offer, I was really very impressed.Boat BassHeads 225 turned out to be exceptional earphones, after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices & music players, I can say that they're amazing for the price, a pure steal deal. The bass output is amazing and is very intense, I'll recommend using correct size ear tips & good quality music player like Poweramp (Android) for better bass output. The treble is good & vocals are average, somewhere I feel that bass overpowers the vocals, but by tweaking the equalizer a bit you can achieve better results. The mids are again average.*****************************My Rating : 4 out of 5*****************************____________________The Verdict---------------------------------Taking everything into account, overall I'm very impressed with Boat BassHeads 225. The Built quality is amazing, the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass & good overall soundstage. Tweaking the equalizer a bit can bring drastic improvements to other areas like vocals, mids & highs. Overall the vocal & highs are good & mids are average but still good for the price. I'll recommend these IEM's to bass lovers & budget-conscious people who are looking for high quality & durable earphones at a reasonable price. Genres like EDM, Rock, Hip-Hop sound really great on them. Boat BassHeads 225 justify the price they come for, the results are very good as compared to other earphones in same price range.HOPE I HELPED YOU.THANKS,Yes, so you have heard that this is the best wired earphone under 500. Yes you can consider it to buy. But there are few points to remember before buy. From my user experience I can tell you this-1. This is not comfortable at all. It slips from ear mostly. You feel pain in ear after using it.2. Never buy this for ONLINE CLASS, as it is not possible to wear it 6-8 hours straightly.3. After switching from Boat Basshead 172, I feel that the bass is not good as the previous one. I don't know why. It should be better.4. Sound don't explode or go outside of the buds to 50% as it go outside on Boat 510 headphone, so its good.5. Feeling heavier on ears. Not as comfortable as Realme Buds 2. Though both are metal build. For balance sound you can buy Realme Buds 2.6. Buy it only to listen music, not for too long time. Do not consider it for Online class and Long time wear session.  Hope it helped you. Its just my opinion from using Boat 225, Boat 172, Boat 510, Realme buds 2, Mi basic.,It's a very good product but i don't recommend buying this because earpiece is heavy and you need to keep adjusting it and pushing it inside whenever you move your head, they will fall off easily with the slightest motion, you will soon find it annoying. Sound quality, build quality everything is good but earphones falling off ears will irritate you.,Raat me apne Babu se dhere dherebaat krne pr v aacha se sunae deta h,I purchased the product a year ago.It worked fine.I love the sound quality.but you may not expect it to work after a year.My headphone doesn't work  now properly .My warranty get expired so ,I have to buy a new one.,Good buy but 1 side earphone stopped after 6-7 month,Sound quality is above average .. but I got 1.5 years old manufactured ear phones.. build quality is as per cost . can't expect much .. there is buzzzzz sound when music is silent..,The earphones sound is awesome", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/3101FmUqUOL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/boAt-BassHeads-225-Special-Headphones/dp/B01MF8MB65/ref=sr_1_191?qid=1672903004&s=computers&sr=1-191"}

I tried all possible combinations and it was apparent that the ram I received was defective.I head straight to replace the product but there was no option for that. No return option as well. I only had one option to contact the customer care so, I contacted them and explained the issue in detail. They asked me to hold and connected me to an so called expert. The expert did not ask me anything just asked me to upload a picture that I already did. Then so called expert asked me to upload the picture on the link that she would be sharing, which I never received. I even tried rating but thanks to the amazon iOS app even that was not possible coz there was no scroll bar on the rating tab. I do not know whether I would receive any support or not but this was a pathetic experience and I had never expected this from amazon. It would be an end for this 8+ years old bond with amazon if I would not receive any support on this.I will update this if I receive some help!Issue fixed after struggling 4 days.

I felt very good performance uplift in my laptop after installing both SSD & this 8 GB ram.,My laptop had 8GB ram before I ordered crucial DDR4 8gb Sodimm RAM and it's really increase multi-task, my coding experience also increase, Android Studio Take less time than before, Still I didn't play any game yet..But I will update you when I play any game in future,First of all let me clear any confusion for other buyer , it's r*8 ram which i received clearly mentioned on the ram sticker 8gb operating at 3200mhz ,If your existing ram in your laptop is operating less then 3200mhz it will automatically reduce its MHz to default (the ram which alredy installed in your laptop) .,Initially I doubted coz i dnt have much idea about all these electronic but after watching YouTube videos I finally installed it and it worked.My Laptop Aspire A5 with 4gb installed ram, now it is 8+4=12 gb.Lets c if my laptok gives good performance.,Good ram on a good price .It's a dual ranked 3200 mhz ram.Many say that you can't use a 8 gb and 16 gb in dual channel mode but believe me u can.If u don't know about ur system configuration then before buying just scan with crusial scanner.,Good RAM with decent price, easy to install and so far performance looks good. Have to test it during gaming. But so far so good.", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/51esjcOy79L._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Crucial-PC4-25600-SODIMM-260-Pin-Memory/dp/B08C4Z69LN/ref=sr_1_210?qid=1672903005&s=computers&sr=1-210"}

This is not sufficient, if we want more details. However the unit is robust, easy to disassemble, easy to replace battery with generic battery, having best transfer time (less than 4 milli Sec) 37min backup for CPU + Monitor when checked. In view of this,  the Legrand Numeric UPS Digital 600EX-V should my the number one choice. But it also has low  user ratings.The  following brands  came to my notice on search.1) APC BX600C-IN2) APC BX600CI-IN3) Emerson Liebert iTon CX 600(I have not considered microtek, intex, iball; vguard etc may be they are good)The technical parameters of the above all looked similar , like generator compatibility, AVR, High/low/overload protections. But the transfer time specified for Numeric is less than 4 milli sec, for  APC 10 milli sec typical, and for Liebert 4-8 milliseconds.APC BX600C-IN  is selected as my requirement is not for PC or laptop (further search is not done for UPS with communication port and auto save software ) and  in view of better interface  ( Power LED Dual color, Charging LED Dual colour, Battery saver LED ) . It also has  better backup and surge power than APC BX600CI-IN (minus resettable thermal relay)Based on the reviews, there are four major issues i have noticed,(1) very old stock (Battery capacity expected to be in reduced condition, resulting into low backup time) or battery issue.(2) Transit damages, as it is bulky to its volume. Though it is better to purchase such items offline, I still tried online in view of remote location.(3) No load protection .  It acts  if very low load is connected (e.g. just modem  or less than 30w and battery saver mode is on  ) after 5 min , people get confused it as giving only 5 min backup (it shouldn't be considered as a problem once known, since additional loads can be connected or battery saver mode can be unselected)(4) If Battery saver is enabled , it shutdowns while 5 min juice still left (it shouldn't be considered as  a problem,  since it can be unselected if selected intentionally or unintentionally)To reduce the above risks, M/s Appario Retail Private Ltd was chosen (at lightening deal at Rs Rs2659.00). The order was placed on 10.04.19. The product is delivered in 4 days on 13.04.19. The original packing was wrapped in repeated turns of polyethylene. The packing reached without any major distortions. The original cartoon packing was in sealed condition. However when it was opened, some (parts) looseness sound was coming from the UPS. The same was reported to APC service center. They registered the complaint and told me that the service person will visit within 48 hours of working days. Further they have given clearance to put the UPS in service.First it was charged fully , while UPS in off condition (charging light was on while charging and it became off after charging). Now the UPS was made on by power button (it is to be pressed and hold for not less than 1 second before release or release after beep tone) connected to PC with 32 inch LED TV, initially some repeated chattering (without any power interruption to the load) was happening, if power input is kept off (on battery). It was happening some times.When it is on battery,  beep sound was occurring every 22 sec against APC Manual spec of 60 sec.it withstood for 18 minutes for the PC with 32 inch LED TV on battery. (Battery save mode was in off condition)Further it got switched off within 5 sec of low battery alarm, against 60 sec specified in the manual.The manufacturing date as per slip glued on original packing was Nov, 2018 (photo attached) but the test and quality passing date is 11.01.2018 12.53 hrs (photo attached)(As my load is more than 30w,  I can put it on battery saver mode, the battery saver button to be pressed and hold for not lessthan 2 seconds before release to change the state , this  is minor but the holding time is no where written in the manual).The UPS body temperature appears to be on higher side, when compared to Numeric installed at office under similar ambient temperature (while on load with input mains as well as while in off condition without charging but connected to mains).The above is initial experience only, any updates shall be shared in future.Note1: This item isn't eligible for returnFor safety reasons, items containing flammable liquids or gases can't be returned to Amazon. For more information or help, please contact them.(If you want return facility search for other alternatives)Update 1The service person called me on 14.04.19 and informed about his planned visit on 15.04.19.The service person visited in the morning of 15.04.2019 and disassembled the UPS, there was a  minor play with the battery, ( the whole casing is of plastic, one side cover opens including top as one part) the play may be due to design / manufacturing tolerances. The PCB and the transformer were already firmly fastened to body and all connections were also tight. Hence the looseness is acceptable. The battery manufacturing date was Oct 2018. I agreed for his optional proposal to replace with a new sealed battery (but manufactured in Sept 2018). The chattering may be relevant to building wiring, as it is not happening with main sockets in other rooms or if we remove UPS input plug from the same socket (see next update for accurate reason) .  In the whole,  the service person\u2019s only concern was hotter transformer, based on his experience (but it will be replaced only if it fails).Prompt response of service center is appreciable (that too for an interior of 76 km from service center, located at state capital) and it compliments the non return policy.Update 2It is fully charged with replaced battery  and backup time was tested with the same load as above. But this time large improvements were observed in the backup time and  parameters (difficult to reason out) as below.Backup time is 32 Min (until some different  type of blinking of power led  & different type of beeps happens for few seconds, may be relevant to battery saver mode  and however it got normalized in auto ) after 5 min further,  the battery low blinking of power LED occurred (hence total 37 min against 18 min of earlier experience as above) and these beeps occurred for 40 seconds before it tripped (against 5 seconds of earlier experience as above), but power LED was glowing for every few seconds till further 20 seconds in off condition.Battery on  beep was occurring for every 59.90 seconds (~1 min) to indicate the load is on battery (against every 22 second earlier experience as above). I was totally involved with service person as it has to protect very costly, bulky and  distant service partner type equipment at my home . He has replaced only battery, and he has not even removed the PCB. But how,  so many wonders have happened is yet to be analyzed and reasoned out.Note 2:I) NonRMS-Multimeter does not properly read the voltage of a UPS that uses stepped approximated output sine wave while on battery. Hence  output voltage of a 230 VAC UPS is measured to be between 170-180 VAC when on battery.Ii) Low voltage cut off will act if any separate low voltage , high voltage cutoff protection is used at outlet of UPS (while on battery)Iii) chattering may take place at UPS if any separate surge protection is used at UPS outletIv) some body already advised not to use any surge protection at input to UPSV) APC service person informed that APC UPS will not on, if house is not properly grounded (earthing is to be proper) to protect from surges.Vi) if UPS is on battery with battery saver mode enabled  (i.e. mains off) it will give only 5 min backup to loads less than  30w (as no load protection acts),  however if the load is more than 30w , it shutdowns while 5 min juice still left ( i.e. if we disable battery saver mode  we will get 5 min more backup power)From the above , the UPS is now functioning as per specifications. (but one star of APC is reduced against initial issues of equipment, though super fast response exists from their service center) , 5 stars to  \"M/s Appario Retail Private Ltd\" the seller, 5 stars to the APC service center and 5 stars to courier \" M/s Delivery\" for safe and fast delivery.Update 3: After 4 months of use , backup time testing (ignoring erroneous tests in between):The ups was made on and battery saver was made off , due to this  the ups started self charging further and I have waited till the charging is completed. Now,  the TV as monitor with PC were made on ( it took upto 0.45 amp during cold boot , amp measured with clamp meter) while mains is on. once the PC stabilised (0.3A) the mains is switched off. Now it gavea  backup of 17 minutes with beep every minute and given repeated beeps at 17th min. Again every min one beep started for 5 min. After this repeated beeps occurred  for 30 second and ups got tripped. Hence I got 22 minutes and 30 seconds in total. In view of this the star rating is retained at 4 star.One more observation is that it's transformer temperature is high while it is on battery that means (more) energy is being wasted by transformer.I got the battery replaced one more time on 15,01.2020 under warranty as backup time reduced to 11min under the same conditions and load. With new battery I am getting 24 minutes. Hence the Apc is being letdown by battery manufacturer where Apc quality person should have control. After warranty I will install battery from exide and see.,Pros:The device is sleek, small and blends into the environment.Cons:Makes a lot of noise.I bought this primarily to support my television Sony XR-65X90K to handle the switch from generators to mains (For < 30 Secs). It is not sufficient to do that and the TV switches on and off continuously when running on UPS power. I'm not sure what the problem is as the wattage is sufficient.If you have a similar use case as mine, better consult a local inverter shop and get a UPS that fits your requirement. Else, you will end up with dead weight.,Easy to install,My PC has a 550W PSU with 80+ Bronze effeciency but installed components are not supposed to go beyond 280watts under max load. This UPS shuts down as soon as my GPU (GTX 970) reaches 100%.Then I used it for my printer. But as soon as I hit print, the UPS shuts down. So it's useless there as well.Now it's attached to my TV, router and speakers. Atleast I can watch Netflix uninterrupted.,I'm getting trouble in this I think this is not working properly where should I return,Value for money, so far working good.,Small but big life of battery,It is good for electricity stability", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/31sSNZUSkfL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/APC-BX600C-600VA-230V-Back/dp/B016XVRKZM/ref=sr_1_211?qid=1672903005&s=computers&sr=1-211"}

They serve the purpose of a decent pair of tws for basic quality calls and music listening. Main problem I noticed was with the pairing and connection strength as they routinely lose signal for no apparent reason. Once or twice I had issue of only one of the buds getting paired and had to reset the other one to get it paired.If you have paired these to one device and try to pair to another one without disconnecting from first it simply doesn't work. This is starting to get annoying but maybe I'll get used to it. We'll see.----------------------------------------------------------This is just day 1 review of these. Got them for Rs 898 on some offer on Amazon. I'll post updates later on. Hope this is helpful for anyone interested.Package : The packaging is quite decent for such a low price. Comes with the tws earphones fitted with medium earplugs fitted inside the case. Also included are a very short USB c cable and two additional earplugs - small and large. Package includes some Noise stickers and a pretty good user manual and warranty instruction card.Build : was immediately dissapointed with the plastic case as the lid was rattling and not confidence boosting. Will use it for a while to see if my worries are unfounded. The earphones themselves are rather sturdy feeling in hand. They fit very snuggly into the case and there is no evident feel of them coming lose or rattling within the case.Comfort : This is very subjective and each ear is different. It's one of the reaonss I wanted to get a cheap tws to see if I'm OK with the form factor for long hours. The prefitted medium size earplugs were not comfortable so I switched to the small size ones. And after about 20 mins I forgot I was even wearing them. The earbuds are very lightweight owing to the plastic build but upside is that they don't cause any strain even after an hour of continuous use. One thing to note is that if you have \"Gandhi\" ears then the fit might be a little awkward - I should know. My ears covered the touch areas of the buds so I had to fiddle around a bit if I wanted to do any of the touch actions. YMMV.Sound quality : I liked them. I'm no audiophile but they have decent volume and satisfactory levels of bass and separation. I tried my usual test at https://youtu.be/J0a2Prc_MQo and they fared quite well. The treble maxes out at 15khz post which you hear nothing at all but this is to be expected at the price point. There was noticeable vibrations creeping in at below 30hz but the L and R drivers seem to be matched well and all of the panning tests were quite decent. I feel this definitely punches above its price point.Call quality : In a low to no outside noise environment the microphones were very good. There was no lag and the person on the other side said my voice was very clear. But things take a steep fall as soon as little noise is present and you start sounding like you're inside a well. Seems the mics can't figure out how to filter out your voice so they end up trashing the call quality. Overall you get what you pay for here.Range : max I got was around 5m. Not sure how they tested and got 10m as advertised. Any disruptions like a wall will simply break the connection but they connected back automatically every time so far so I guess that's passable.Pairing :------ UPDATE on 12th Aug 2022  - - - - - -Major issue here is that if already paired to a device like a laptop they simply are unable to be paired to another device like your phone. You have to unpair from the first device and then try to pair again. Had issues like only one of the buds pairing as well.Have to fiddle around to get it to work and is not convenient.---------------I don't have a phone to test the fast pair features - Actually I'm not even sure these support it. Anyway, the earphones go into pairing mode as soon as you remove them from the case and I was able to pair with no problems on multiple phones. They will auto pair post this initial setup to previously paired devices. I could not find any way to control the pairing mode though. You have to live with what it comes with as there is no app or anything to control what it does. They switch off pairing mode once you put them in the case so hopefully that means the battery would be saved a little.Battery life : Way too early to tell anything. Will share my experience post one week and one month. But they came around 80% charged in the box and I have stated to charge the case - Box says it will take 2hrs to fully charge it and there are basic indicators like a flashing red led for charging which turns solid red once done. The earphones also have LEDs that blink red & white to indicate pairing, low battery etc.Sync issues : None so far. But have seen many such reports and reviews wherein the L and R earphones seem to go out of sync on similar low price TWSes. So will see if I face any such problems.These are the primary areas that I am concerned with while evaluating any TWS so will share how my experience is after a while. So far I'm happy with them.,Hi, My name is Akshay.I used this product and this is very good in sound and valuable money.good in calling also.everything is perfect.,Good Sound Quality...,Buds are very good Quality.

Lookwise it does feel sturdy but depending on the usages it will show how long ot will last,At all stages one side of the stand doesn't fit properly.,Not that perfect, one side has a little gap,Quite satisified with the product after about 2 weeks of use. Value for the money. Ergonomics is satisfactory, but still it needs to be looked into. From the looks of it, it would have a long term durability also.,This is an awesome product that I have purchased till date for my WFH purpose. It can hold 14\" Laptop very well. It can be adjusted for different heights. Grip to the table is really good. It helps to view the laptop with required angle. Easy to carry. Looks really great on a black table. Classic silver piece. Packaging is also very good.,3.5 starsI got this delivered today and tried it out. My laptop is 2.5 KG and 17 inches, a bit of a heavy machine.While the stand held my laptop, it did not fit properly. Because of the laptop's weight or the size, the front of the laptop raises instead of staying on the padded notches. Have to move the machine forward a bit for it to stay on.If you want to use it as simply a stand - where you set the laptop and use external devices to use it like the mouse, gamepad or the keyboard, it is fine. You can go for it.If you want to use the machine itself when on the stand - touchpad and keyboard, you might face some issues. Using it directly is making the machine a bit wobbly.Will test it out with heavy work / gaming to see how the temperature holds. Might edit the review and the rating after using it a bit.,The product itself is awesome and in modern day where ease to carry and compact products are preferred it is a good choice , my only reason to give 4 stars and removing one out of five is the product latches (linkages/arms that set the level of elevation angle ) are bit free And can be undone from one of either side with a slight jerk while the second side latch supports all the weight in the meantime.,It is very convenient and compact to carry along with you.

A Lenovo 300 FHD webcam with a \"wide-angle\" vision and stronger mics makes more sense if you want to invest a little money. Spend the money on Logitech C920 or C922 if you really want to start a live stream or tutorial videos that are more professional; you won't regret. If you already have a point and shoot camera or DSLR at home, get a cheap capture card so you can set it up as a webcam.Pros:Simple plug-and-play is available.The camera offers a regular mode and a wide angle option.The Universal Clip prevents the robust cam from toppling.The green led indicates whether or not the camera is active.Cons:Incompatible with bezel-less displays.The picture and mic quality is poor.Face recognition is too bad.The image will be grainy and noisy.\u20b9 1,699  seriously no!!!!Conclusion:Choose it if there is no better choice available between \u20b9500 and \u20b91200. It will assist you momentarily. You need enough lighting, and you shouldn't rely on the webcam's microphone.,Does the job.", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/316Q0fvU+2L._SY300_SX300_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Logitech-C270-HD-Webcam-Black/dp/B008QS9J6Y/ref=sr_1_230?qid=1672903006&s=computers&sr=1-230"}

Probably a direct plug in extension (no cord) would be a much better option.,Needed a portable USB extension. Headphones, keyboard and mouse. Serves the purpose for an indoor setting. Have explained why it is not an outdoor device under the cons.Pros:- Nice design, Sleek, unobtrusive suits some work environments. For those who have limited table estate, go for models that have vertical USB slots, saves space. This is for those who can have it flat next to the laptop/computer. (check image)- Works well for Audio, HIDs, and great for Data Transfer.Observation:- An interesting observation when using usb keyboard, the USB drive is as if not more sensitive than direct typing. With mechanical USB keyboards there is a latency but chiclet and USB Dongle based wireless keyboards seem to work well.- USB or wireless USB (RF) mouse works perfectly. Very little noticeable latency- Not for gaming purposes (keyboards/mice/joysticks etc.). This is a no brainer. In rapid response gaming environments were latency is life or death. An extension is not an option.Cons: (Check Image)The USB female slots in the extension are shallow. The male plugs do not go in fully. There is 0.5 cm of the metal plug exposed. This may be a risk in exposed/outdoor environments. Humidity increases the chances of electric shock, and dust being an insulator may cause static electricity build up. The worst case is if a conductor falls across the exposed points, the whole system can short out.Suggest the designers take this into consideration for their next batch of products. The depth of the USB slots needs to accommodate the full length of the USB plugs.Functionally it works, design leaves a lot wanting. Go for it if are sure you can be safe, go for a different model if you need this for outdoor use.Update: 15th Nov 2022On connecting the keyboard to the usb drive, there seems to be an increased latency and sometimes the keyboard does not respond as anticipated. The text does not appear on the screen immediately and sometimes a particular letter just cascades repeatedly, and one has to press backspace often to delete the excess letters. For data transfer it works fine but has lower speeds, when all four slots are being used. Expected probably!,Works well and does the job.,I like it very much.Value for money...,Product is excellent. Just that wire is very short ! Rest all good,Using in laptop,Useful USB multiplier and works well for headsets too ( was apprehensive earlier if it deteriorates the audio quality)Only drawback is the length of cable as it keeps protruding out of Laptop bag", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/21UKIwf0IVL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Portronics-MPORT-Ports-USB-Connector/dp/B09M8888DM/ref=sr_1_231?qid=1672903006&s=computers&sr=1-231"}
