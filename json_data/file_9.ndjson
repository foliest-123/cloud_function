It lacks base. Battery backup is good. ANC is a myth in this earphone. It might hurt your ear if you wear it for longer duration depending on the shape of your ear,Eat easily fit in ears and light weight ,and sound quality is good too. Over all its worth to by this samsung buds ita connects well to the samsung mobile too.,Bought this solely due to its form factor - to try how samsung has made them to sound in this open bud style. To be true Samsung has managed excellently to give us an unique TWS.This is not an inear style TWS but resembles somewhat earbud style TWS, only of its kind in the market as far as my Knowledge goes.They are held very good in my ears, gives me a good seal and does not fall out (strange as I can't use earbuds because they fall out frequently). It seems that Samsung has finalised the shape after a good homework. However, it doesn't mean that it will fit everybody as there are many dissatisfied users around the globe.The finish, build and all such generic factors are top notch.  The size of the buds and the case is very small.Now about the sound. If the buds fit in one's ears with a good seal, the sound is full bodied but if the seal is not perfect, it may be tinny.The sound signature is very bassy for my taste and I have to eq it to my taste. The bass is so pounding that sometimes it becomes difficult to get a taste of the treble. I listen it in TREBLE BOOST mode adjusted through the app. ANC works strangely and noise reduction is not very decipherable. In contrary, ANC ON somewhat opens up the sound. Don't buy this for ANC.Strangely to me, these buds sound better on my iPhone 12mini than my Galaxy S22 (Spotify and Apple Music). The buds have app support for both Android (Galaxy wear) and iOS (Galaxy Buds Live) but the Android app is more feature packed and works better.  The iOS app couldn't update the firmware (although there is a Menu in the app) and always showed the device to be on latest firmware. However,  as soon as I connected with my S22, on pairing,  the first thing it did was to update the firmware.I love these buds solely for their form factor and they are pretty good for 4.4K against an MRP of 16K. The do sound very good but does not suit my taste.  Persons loving bass may love them. Don't get them for ANC. Battery consumption not yet fully tested but seems ok. It has wireless charging too. If your ears are too small or too large than normal - better not to buy as they may either not go in the ears or will fit loose giving a improper seal.,Best call quality. Noise cancelling could have been improved to best, but still wotks good.Descent battery life.Music is good. Not to that top notch, but good in this segment.Overall worth for buying with good call quality a very little to compromise but good.,I am using this for like 3 months it is a good and productive if you are in the samsung ecosystem if you are not a part then do not buy it its not worth its price.,Bluetooth range is not that good,The sound quality is extremely good for a tws and the sound signature is almost flat. I got these for Rs.5290, it almost felt like a steal deal for me until I faced one cardinal flaw in the design of these buds. The bluetooth antenna has an absymal performance. It feels like I am using bluetooth v3.0. The range is so poor that even if you put the phone in the pocket, the audio starts stuttering. The mic quality is a hit or miss, inside the house it works very well, but outside it performs poorly. I think it has more to do with poor antenna design than the microphone's quality. If you are thinking that maybe the faulty product is an exception, then do a google search about its range issue and you will find hundreds of people complaining about the same thing. Samsung has poorly implemented the design and is reluctant to admit its fault. I pity those who bought it at around 15k for such a flawed product.

Review 1 is 30 days after purchase (Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now) and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update. These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022.Before OOS 13 update, 5G (only for Jio) was enabled via another update. 5G is still not available in my region. Hence, 5G related parameters are not covered in this review.Review 2: After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update (Android 13):(Update received on 1 Dec 2023).Note: After the beta update, no new issues popped up.i.e., there were;No Heating related issues.No fast battery drain.No change in the Charging time.No annoying bugs.No change in camera performance.Beta update is mostly like a Stable update.OOS 13 (Android 13) update review:Delighters:> No new apps added. Absolutely NOT.> System storage consumption remains the same (13.2 GB).> Animations are more fluidic.> More customization UI features added. (Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder & lot more.)> Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier.> Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor.> Ability to play videos in the background & screen OFF as well (even for YouTube)  (Really a welcoming & longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF)> Stand-by battery life has improved substantially.Disappointers:> Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before.> No improvement in Sound levels. Still initial 40% is too silent.> No Dolby Atomos (which was mentioned for OOS 13). Perhaps, to wait for Stable update.> Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier. Response time is tad increased.> Haptics have become tighter than earlier, but still not stronger.=======================================================================Review 1:Verdict - A Good Buy in this price range in 2022.Note:- This review is after a month's usage.- Received 2 updates during the course of time (Recent update was of 0.98 GB).- System consumes 13.2 GB space. 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage.- N77 band is missing for 5G.- The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue.- Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile. No noticeable difference observed. ( In Non-gaming aspect)- Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parameters.Things that are delighting;> Exceptional signal reception (especially 4G+ carrier aggregation). Very fast download speeds.> Insane Fast charging (0 to 100% in 40 mins, 30 to 100 % in 20 mins, excluding trickle charge). No heating of the mobile (just slight warming) during charging.> Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic (Even more than 7.5 hrs, for Videos, YT and general tasks and calls, even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver.> Oxygen OS = Color OS/Realme OS - Bloatware. The skin is really good & nothing to complain like other brands' UI.> Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps. Even some 2nd party apps are \"un-installable\". No major bothering bugs noticed till date.> Yes, the \"Alert slider\" is included, unlike some premium OnePlus models.Things that are annoying;> Dual ambient light sensor (1 in rear and other in front) is not well calibrated. The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required.> Volume level is useless until 40% level (can be audible only in \"Pin-drop silence ambience). Audible enough only post 40% level. Stereo speakers output are 70% bottom and 30 % earpiece. But full volume doesn't distort & is loud enough.> Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40% and best only @ 90% level)> Hotspot drains battery quickly (even a warning notification pops up). Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly. Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm).> Though the in-hand feel is good, the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit.> Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel.> The inbuild DAC (no 3.5 mm hole and only Type-C port) is not great. The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio output.,Overall it's a good mobile phone. The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long. Not much, i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about 18-20 hours on normal use.. not many themes available. Samsung is better in that sense.. there are many wallpapers and themes available. Display is clear and camera is also good! Overall okay.,I got this mobile (12Gb, 25Gb Ram variant)at 31k after 3k discount on icici credit card.For this price it's a must buy.I am using this product since last 2 weeks.The camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very well.The only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better, as a working professional it doesn't makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a day.If you have no issues with the battery section then just go for it.\ud83d\udc4d,Battery drains like any thing. Rest all good.I have to recharge twice a day, don't buy if you want a good battery backup.Even though phone is fast charge, I am disappointed with battery life.,I bought 12gb and 256 and it's working very smoothly, for normal regular use you can go for it.,There is problem with temper glass part , front Cemera area temper glass not installing,Good but not so fast as I think 12gb 256 it's ordinary like 8gb .,Apart from battery and sound quality, everything else is good.", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41iEc0hf6TL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Jade-256GB-Storage/dp/B0B3D39RKV/ref=sr_1_75?qid=1672895770&s=electronics&sr=1-75"}

Wires are great built and tangle free. The audio jack is compatible with almost all devices and its gold plated as well. I just didn't find the case. It was missing from my product. Though they have given 2 pairs of extra buds with different sizes. Overall it's a great wired in mic earphones. Go ahead and add to your cart. You won't regret it.,So first, let's talk about the external-Bulid quality is awesome 9/10 even at such an affordable price.Looks-I have all 3 colours of these earphones and all colours looks coolWire-the wire quality is 9/10. I have these earphones from 4 months and these haven't tangled since. Also the rubber coating and the inside braided wires gives a nice  looking effect.But 1 thing I have seen is the middle piece which have a mic and buttons is 180 degree reversed. so, many times it's difficult to pick the right or left earphone without seeing. But it is mentioned on the earphones so that becomes easy.Now about the main part the internalsThe sound quality is so so nice. \ud83d\ude0aAs you can see in my title. Solid 8/10. You can listen any music like lofi or peacefull type and when it's time for a party you can listen rock, bass boosted songs with such a adorable quality its the true definition for true sound and at cheap prices.Bass quality is also good.perfect for the ears. And if u want high bass, I tried it with max bass it can produce and that's awesome. But don't listen high bass for long. Those can hurt ur ears really bad.But noice cancellation is 4/10.seems like there is no noice cancellation. Maybe its mentioned for the mic not for the earpiece.Obviously there are very high quality products then this product but those will alteast cost 2000. But I will choose this product instead of a 1500 one or less than 1500 because this cost less than 500 or sometimes less than 400(depends on sale) but quality and services of these products are not less than of a 2000 rs earphone.In past, 1 of my earphone died but the coustmer care is so generous, there services are so cool and quick. So those got replaced within 3 days. (it's 3 days because I forgot the eslip, if you mail them with everting ready it won't take more than 2 working days)It's an honest review by me and I will definitely suggest you to but these. \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude43Edited:-Their services are slower now. Don't know why and it takes around 1. 5week to 2 weeks to get the refund. If something happens to ur earphones.Also its been like 1 year as of 1-9-21And I saw some trend with it. My brother earphones stop producing sound from one side evey 4 months or soBut mine earphones be with me for 5 months.It's not a problem though cause you can mail 'em regarding this. This happened with me even with extra proper care of the earphone.Still the best earphones, you can find at this price point,NOT FOR HIGH BASS LOVERS,Everything was OK but as shown in the picture that you will get a case along with earphones,which was not there inside it(only earphone and some earplucks were there),This range very good product.if your budget under- 400 definitely you can bye this product.,Nice product,Product is good but the accessories like the pouch is not provided as mentioned in the description in the second delivery also, despite the return of first delivery of the product  for REPLACEMENT with pouch,product is good but needs to work on noise cancellation", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41EnFjIAoaL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Boom-Ultima-Headphones-Cancelling-Earphones/dp/B08D75R3Z1/ref=sr_1_77?qid=1672895770&s=electronics&sr=1-77"}

I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.  Nothing Fancy but for the budget it is a good phone.,BATTERY : more than enough for normal use  Not sure in gamingCAMERA : good in this segment , can record  videos in FHD 30fpsDISPLAY : since it's a LCD display the quality is  a bit less , but goodV RAM : you can add upto 2gb of virtual ram  but have to sacrifice your storage  Space to use it  OVERALL A GOOD BUDGET PHONE,Finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41op1vdp-UL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Storage-6000mAh-Battery/dp/B0B4F2TTTS/ref=sr_1_78?qid=1672895770&s=electronics&sr=1-78"}

It is my first ever OnePlus phone. My personal review about this phone is as under:Pros:1. Boxy design looks nice but feels not so premium but if you use its cover it feels nice. Cover quality is very nice.2. Screen is bright even in sunlight if you select auto brightness. Also screen color and touch response feels premium.3. Battery life is very impressive with 1.5 day backup with normal use.4. 80 watt charger is very fast which charge your phone within 30 to 35 minutes.5. I am not a heavy gamer but I tried asfalt 9 which runs very smooth.I think it'll play heavy games smoothly. So it perform well.6. I am new to use Oxygen OS. I feels OS premium and smooth without adds.7. Rear camera shots very good pictures but selfie camera need some improvement which I think can be done via software update.8. No heating issue.9. Lightweight.Cons:1. If you use without case, it doesn't feel like premium phone.2. I don't like the sound quality although is has dual speaker. You can feel vibration on its back pannel which feels very bad.3. Selfie camera needs improvement.4. Zoom is very bad on rear camera.5. No IP certification.6. No expendable storage.7. Paid theme store.8. Should have some dot notch animations like samsung.  At last I can say it is a nice phone with some cons, if you want OnePlus smartphone within Rs. 35000/- you can go for it.,Terrific purchase at the price of 33k. Body I feel light htough it is not as usual OnePlus body as I had been the user of one plus in past also. Metallic sides could be a better option. Sometimes I feel lag in touch though it is for microseconds but it is there. Camera quality is good not awesome. Battery life is good i used to charge once and a day can be completed by itm Obviously, i bought it as it is one of the affordable option in terms of brand. Love to see metallic frames in coming phones. Storage is tremendous and speed is also good m Overall a good purchase a phone can be rated 4 out of 5.,This smart phone is good enough for daily normal use. But battery life is not good enough though is says 5000 mAh. Camera quality is not good enough in this price segment. Although it's Oxygen os, it is not well optimised. From the starting there will be some lagging issue with some apps. Another bad thing about this smart phone is its form factor. The company taking around 39k but giving just a plastic body which will looks like below 20k. If someone wants to buy this i suggest to buy another model don't go for this model because of the brand. One good thing is oneplus promised three major android update and four years security update. Another bad thing its primary camera design. One of the three camera is so big that it's embracing to say its price is 39k.,I would like to get directly to the pros and consPros.1) BATTERY - The first and the best thing about this phone is the damn battery life and how fast it charges. It's just amazing and I have been kind of spoilt by it now, I wont be able to adjust with a lesser battery performance and charging anymore!2.  CAMERA- The camera is amazing and takes some really amazing pictures. No complains.3. LOOKS - The phone looks really beautiful. I got the forest green colour and it looks simply awesome and is eye catching and premium looking.CONS1) The overall working of the phone is not as seamless as it should be provided the hardware it boasts of. Having said that, the factor cannot be a purchase deterrent. It's otherwise quite smooth2) The absence of an alert slider was a disappointed. I was used to it on my 6T3)Volume - Not too happy with the phone speakers. They somehow are not up to the mark.To sum it up- Just go for it if you have a tight budget but want a premium looking, good performing phone. It packs too much for a 43k phone - good battery, fastest charging in the segment, premium looks, good performance.,Using the phone after two days I have noticed weird experience with UI, tapping on grey or black areas screen flickers to that portion and according to service centre it's common issue across all phones and getting fixed by Oxygen 13 update as there were no issue with 10pro.So we have to do nothing but to wait for releasing the new OS update on the 10R and other models as well.Overall device working good so far I experienced average camera results,superb charging but not so extended battery life, touch sensor and speakers are fine and performance is good in my day to day tasks, hopefully UI and OS updates will help to deliver best of this phone.,Over all camera \ud83d\udcf8 is just ammazing I am a youtuber purpuse behind choosing this device is it's processer dimencity 8100max it's a supersaft max performence not even capturing while gaming also it's runs very smoothly and it's my FIRST PREMIUM SMARTPHONE I'm the uploded photos20x zoom lg pic and I have uploded night and day liting pics to compareGood device from one plus,Its speaker is not really working well using it since 6months only plus it dosent comes with a warrenty plan it has to be brought separate camera quality is also okay not thattt good microphone is also been disturbing a lot while talking on the call other side person gets a lot of disturbance", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41pQ4gJMwEL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Forest-Green-Storage-SuperVOOC/dp/B09WRMNJ9G/ref=sr_1_79?qid=1672895770&s=electronics&sr=1-79"}

I am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes \u2013 but I think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. Applying a technocratic approach, I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirements.My foremost requirement \u2013 which is entirely non-negotiable \u2013 is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards, since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers. My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil: a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games (which do not need much memory or processing capacity). I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity (sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage). Besides, I would like to use a new handset for at least two years.Apart from exigencies, I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.I am equally clear about what I do not need. I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera. At the risk of sounding flippant, I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf \u2013 primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golf!Having used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years, I vastly prefer the former. My last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a Samsung M30. Since that model is obsolete now, I focused on its upgraded cousins: M32, M33 and M52. The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card. After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33, I concluded that the latter offers better value for money. Generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. With these considerations, I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage (Just twenty years ago, I was using a desktop with 2GB memory!)As a confirmation for my choice, I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 (8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) which my son had recommended. The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED. I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus product.As for body colour, my first choice was Emerald Brown, but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.Despite a strong family resemblance with my old one (M30), the new phone (M33) offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations (see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage).  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an \u2018immersive listening experience\u2019 and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED. I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the M33 meets my requirements.I was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers \u2013 because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. However, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts, but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.To cut a long story short, I ordered a 25-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. After using the new handset for a couple of weeks, I find that my phone is at 60-70% charge at the end of the day, and it takes 30-40 minutes for complete charging (one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging). It turns out that I could have managed with the old 10-watt charger, except that it would have taken 60-90 minutes for full charging.I conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M33 5g is the perfect phone \u2013 but for my requirements. A word of advice: if you are planning to buy a new phone, it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to use.,With 5G connectivity, a 120Hz display and solid performance, the Galaxy M33 5G is Samsung\u2019s best-value smartphone yet under 20K segmentPros\u00a0Almost half the price of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 is a solid performerExcellent 120Hz display with smooth experience across the boardHuge performance uplift over M32One UI 4.1 based on android 12 has tons of good features to love, none of the flagship grade features are skipped here (apart from dex mode and spen features), Zero lag or stuttering in 120 hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloading\u00a0 of apps, makes using one ui pleasure to surf acrossYou get features like a\u00a0screen recorder,\u00a0video call effects, Game Launcher,\u00a0Link to Windows,\u00a0Dual Messenger,\u00a0Quick Share,\u00a0Music Share, and Secure Folder, along with many others. Some of the fancy Android 12 features, like the ability to\u00a0change the color palette\u00a0of icons and menus based on the wallpaper and\u00a0dim the screen for easier reading in the dark, are also included.Voice focus for calls is excellent feature, phone call quality is really good even in nosiy and crowded areasI had no issues with GPS or connectivity while using Google maps to navigate,\u00a0 signal stays strong even in rural areas, thats a positive point with good accuracy4g Volte with carrier aggregation works flawlesslyWifi connectivity on the Dual band 5ghz router is strong and performs\u00a0 more than satisfactorily with low latency responseBluetooth 5.1 connectivity is strong and has good range\u00a0 no worries of disconnection even as far as 15 metersAudio quality via 3.5 mm jack is excellent compared to Redmi note 10 pro, much more defined and well roundedFor media consumption widewine L1 support is present, Good AV experience on ott platforms, I have no serious complaints about color reproduction in videos considering TFT LCD this panel does a good enough job .Main Camera 50mp is on par and better than Redmi note 10 pro in almost all conditions, retains colors close to reality with good dynamic range and handling of exposure with HDR in photos as well as videos, it is able to handle extremely bright conditions wellEven in shadows during day time it was able to maintain good colorsGood Stable videos at 1080p4k video recording is available at 30 FPS is availableMany cool camera features , boasts AR fun mode, single Take, Object Eraser and Video TNR (Temporal Noise Reduction) which makes it fun to use cameraSelfie camera has good punchy colors, Samsung's way of boosted colour processing some may like it ,some may notExcellent battery life, got 9 hours of SOT despite the heavy usage. It takes around 1.5 hours to go from 0-100, and half an hour of charging can take the battery percentage to around 45% provided you have 25 watt Samsung\u2019s chargerDespite summer time, phone has managed to stay relatively cool, 5nm architecture helping its cause here12 5G BandsDedicated SD card slot is a plus herePD 3.0 25 watt fast charging support reasonable for price segment but we have seen faster charging speeds with other OEMsPromised 2 major android OS updates and 4 years security updates is a huge plus above its competitors, making this device more value for money in long runCons\u00a0Ultrawide camera is on softer side , lacks details compared to its primary sensor but manages to frame good shots that one can post on social media, macro camera is good with colors and edge detection but lacks depth of field and details , Note 10 pro which is brilliant in this caseNight shots are above average mostly grainy and muddled but better than most smartphones in its segmentLacks some stability in Video recording at 4k\u00a0Amoled display could have made it unbeatableLacks stereo Speaker, but audio quality on single speaker is quite goodPre-installed bloatwares like Moj, dailyhunt, sharechat, byju's are mild and uninstallable but makes mature one UI experience looks immature out of the boxCurrently device is not tunned for high gaming performance as limited FPS in popular games like BGMI and COD deters it away from being a gamer friendly device, but we\u00a0 can expect exynos 1280\u00a0 to resolve over time and be more optimized for more games in future updatesSlightly cheap design , Chunky in size, carries some heft, Dated notch displayLack of charger in the box is a bummer, which adds up to the value cost proposition", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419KF2t1nML._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Emerald-Storage-Purchased-Separately/dp/B0B14MR9L1/ref=sr_1_80?qid=1672895770&s=electronics&sr=1-80"}

It is sturdy BUT a bit on HEAVIER side. Can charge three phones at a time if you use the two USB and third Type C port as well for charging. The speed of charging is alright and appropriate. The ONE and only drawback I experienced is the weight of the Power-Bank itself, without this limitation it could be really amazing product to buy.,Bit heavy but does it\u2019s job. Takes tooooooo much time to charge. Whatever mention in the description is not correct at all with regards to the powerbank charging.,I needed an extra power bank with a larger capacity.

When i first received this power bank it came in a small box (approx 12x9x3cm, Mfg: Aug 2019) with everything forced in congested space. The issue i had in this one was that it came with open seal & no poly wrap around product box as if it was a used product or was tampered in between. So was skeptical about the authenticity of the product and ordered a replacement right away.\u2192 This one had USB C cable but no carry pouch.2. When replacement came, it came in a poly-wrapped bigger box (22x10x4 cm, Mfg: Oct 2019) with an outer sleeve and main box inside with a hologram seal. Maybe Ambrane changed the packaging. The hologram seal here was intact but was also not applied properly to secure the opening. Looked like it was applied with an open box. So its presence was useless.\u2192 This one came with Micro USB cable and a carry pouch.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\ud83d\udc5c CARRY POUCH\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2192 As per my analysis carry pouch comes with the latest October lot which comes in a bigger box and was unavailable in earlier lot with a small box.\u2192 Carry pouch size was appropriate for power bank and i had no trouble inserting power bank in it. (Some users reported it having a smaller opening but i had no trouble with it and found it to be a proper fit. Neither loose nor tight.\u2192 Its soft nylon meshed pouch and is a nice addon.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\ud83c\udfc6 VERDICT\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u25b6 At the price point its not a bad deal. Its a midway path b/w low quality and high-quality ones. You can very well go for Ambrane, as it makes good quality & durable power banks. Rest, nothing is perfect in this world. For this thing only, 10 days replacement policy from Amazon and 1-year warranty from Ambrame is available.\u25b6 If one can extend the budget by a few hundred, MI power bank will be a better option with a metallic body & better quality overall. I have MI, Honor & Ambrane power bank and their overall rating will be (from low to high) Ambrane \u2192 Honor \u2192 MI,I am putting up this review after 1 day of usage. This is the second power bank i have bought from Ambrane India overall third power bank for my family. Before to this i have bought their PP-30 30000 mah model and also has MI 2i 20000 mah power bank both were really good, here i am putting together all the pros and cons which i am able to find after 1 day of usage and also a little bit of comparison. My dad uses Redmi note 7, my mom has MI A1 and i am using Redmi note 3Pros:-- Dual Input Type C and Micro USB this is the foremost and primary reason of choosing this power bank over MI or other brands as you don't need to carry two cables if your phone has type c input which in my family 2 out of 3 has  the same- Easy to carry and hold as it is very compact is size i must say in comparison to MI or Ambrane PP-30- Solid and sturdy built- 20000 mah capacity with same lithium polymer batteries these are safer then lithium ion batteries, this i came to know while buying this product-  \u20b9200 cheaper price than MI- Touch button at the top to know the power status (this is something unique)-  It took less than 1 hour to charge my redmi note 3 from 13% to 100% at 2 cell battery indicator, which is pretty good and almost equivalent to my wall charger best part same time and charging speed in Delhi Metro- I don't know either it is pro or con, both of my other power banks supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 Technology while this power bank supports only fast charging at 2.4 Amp, but i feel this has charged my phone better and faster than MI power bank itself. I know a phone must also supports quick charge technology for fast charging but when i use quick charge on my dad's Redmi note 7 (which supports QC 4.0) either from MI power bank or Ambrane PP-30 power bank it kind of heats up the phone, also it fluctuates the power and automatically switches between Quick Charge and fast charging which affects your battery life, so it is safer to charge the phone at optimum current at 2.4 ampCons:-- Very stuffy packaging, it looks like the power bank has been forced fully stuffed inside the box- It has some adhesive tape at the top i don't know why ? which, when you remove it, puts scratches on the top, be careful while removing the same- No torch light, their PP-30 have it- only micro cable inside the box,Definitely heavy but I knew this. I will recommend this, as it has 2 slots so we can charge two phones.,Nice product,Power backup is good.. but the USB cable provided is very bad.

I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.

The Boat Xtend Smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the Apple watch. Moreover, it has built-in Amazon Alexa support, SpO2 tracking, stress tracking, and much more. Coming in a budget segment, is it worth it? Should you buy this smartwatch? If you too have such queries, then there is nothing to worry about. It is a detailed review of Boat Xtend Smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about it.ContentsBox ContentDesign, Build & ComfortDisplayWatch UI And FeaturesAlexa SupportWatch FacesBoat Wave AppAccuracyBatteryFinal WordsBuy Now:Box ContentBoat Xtend box contentSmartwatch in black&gold colourCharging clipUser Manual and warranty cardDesign, Build & ComfortWhen buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.Boat Xtend design and buildI personally don\u2019t like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don\u2019t look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.Boat Xtend designThe watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.DisplayComing to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won\u2019t notice the bezels, and the screen quality won\u2019t feel cheap at all. It doesn\u2019t have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.Boat Xtend display qualityI find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn\u2019t something that we can complain about in this price range.Watch UI And FeaturesThe UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn\u2019t much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won\u2019t find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that\u2019s why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.Boat Xtend UiThe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.Boat Xtend smartwatch reviewAlexa SupportThe main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won\u2019t find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won\u2019t prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won\u2019t be a problem.Boat Xtend Alexa supportWatch FacesThe next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.Boat Xtend watch facesBoat Wave AppYou will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won\u2019t be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven\u2019t noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.Boat Xtend boat wave appAccuracyAccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.Boat Xtend accuracy testCompared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don\u2019t find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.Boat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.Boat Xtend accuracyBatteryYou get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.Final WordsBoat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn\u2019t like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000.,Pros:1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.3. Large (1.69\"), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.7. Definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.12. Training, Sports modes r good.13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.14. Find my phone works well.15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.Cons:1. Lacks vibration intensity control.2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.6. Battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.11. No calling feature. But it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000.

Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.,It's good value for money smart watch.Light weight.

I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures.

I am not a person who believes to burn money for phones. My requirement was a phone that has good network reception, good wifi reception, a balanced software, good battery life, good screen that don't strain eyes, a good hardware, 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a charger. i don't need 5G network because 5G drains battery a lot and 5G spends too much data. I don't watch movie or YT on mobile network and I wonder how many does watch FHD, 2K, 4K videos over mobile network. For downloading documents, social networks, banking apps 4G is more than enough.In my budget I found all phones have 4gb RAM. Realme Narzo 50 was 9999/- during GIF and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was Redmi note 11. But I found that if I can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer I can get a Redmi note 11 with 6gb RAM at 11749/- . 6gb RAM is always preferred over 4gb RAM because nobody knows whether with future updates the OS would demand more RAM or not, also the softwares may require more RAM as time passes away. So this was the only option I knew then available.Redmi note 11 has AMOLED Display, I am not bothered with 60Hz, 90Hz,120Hz. I keep the refresh rate at 60Hz and display works without zero lag or stutter. All my Desktop screen has 60Hz refresh rate and I am happy with them so why do I need a 90 Hz screen? I think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers. The display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich. You can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but I think standard is fine for me. Also you can calibrate display colours in settings but I think you don't need that. Display size is 6.43 inch it could have been better if it were 6.7 inch. I prefer big display phone. Redmi note 12 has that big display. A plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and I am happy with that. The screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth. The screen has a punch hole camera which looks good.This phone duel speakers. One is more powerful at bottom and another on top. But i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or YT. Bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. What more do you expect from such tiny speakers!The phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. Many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience I can say my phone and Wifi modem stays at different floor, still I get good signal, and never disconnected. Voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. However because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.The phone has 5000mAh battery and comes with 33W charger which is a bonus at this price point. The battery gives long backup. With good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, FB, WA etc. But I charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70%.The phone has SD680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. The experience is butter smooth. However the apps get automatically cleared from RAM which I like because I don't have to clear RAM manually. However after Android 12 update the RAM hold App for longer time but eventually cleared. SD 680 doesn't heat up and it is very energy efficient. Because of that battery drains very little and 33W charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage. The cable is USB A to C and feels good.This phone has IR blaster so in your home office you can control AC or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.This phone has DDR4X RAM and UFS 2.2 storage. The RAM is 6GB and can be expanded additional 1 GB as virtual RAM by occupying storage. But I have disabled that option from settings because it increases SSD life. This has 2 Sim + SD card slot. Which is a great. Both SIM have VoLTE and carrier aggregation.The phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. Some people may complain about plastic But remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. And I have no problem with plastic. I don't think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. I am happy with plastic back. The phone also gives a TPU cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. This is inherent chemistry of TPU, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. How ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.The fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. The touch screen is excellent too.However I dont like some of the preinstalled apps. Some can be uninstalled a few can't especially Mi pay and getapps from mi store. I don't like them. However I like the pre installed security app. There is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled. Camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. Does not show pictures like 8MP camera. I have added some pictures clicked by Redmi note 11 back camera. MiUi is fluid and has many user friendliness like OneUI. MiUI is now free of Bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.So I give Redmi 11 a score of 9.5/10. This is an excellent phone the I got at 11749/- during Great Indian festival. I recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. This phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2K, $k videos or shoot such things. This is not or those who are crazy for 5G. Otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. Good battery LIFE. Bqest for day-day use. 33W charger also good.2. Best display but should've 120hz instead of 90.3. Sturdy in-hand feel4. Stereo speaker is loud and crisp(65-35 split).5. Camera above average... But good concerning the price.6. Buggy UI(minor) as expected. But ui13 all way better than bloody MIUI 12.5.7. 4G chipset SD 680, which is fine... 4G+ always available.8. Some minor issue with WiFi reception. Don't know may be they will fix it through OTA.*** THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CLICKS PHOTOS HERE & THERE, CASUAL GAMER & BINGE WATCHERS OF WEB SHOWS/MOVIES... \"NOT INTENDED FOR HEAVY GAMING\"NOT FOR PUBG, COD LOVERS.,The first look of this starbust design is eye catchy...no word to express its design,in hand feel and and it's all physical dimension. the second this which impress me, it's battery backup.....even you playing game hardly for a long time....it gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also 33W, is also a good deal at this price. The third impressive factor is it's dual speaker....I have an another phone of 40k and the sound quality is almost same as it. Media playback experience is also enhanced by it's amoled display, very colour charming display...... literally the display quality is unbeatable. The camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience. Other Performance like gaming is also good at this price point. Fingerprint button is also very responsive. All other things and features are good to the price point.Only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade...even my old Redmi Y2 which I exchanged with this, had better camera than this ....So plz I request you to all .... don't buy this for camera....just don't. The images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to me......I don't recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phone.If you are non camera user then you will surely go for it.Pros- design, in-hand feel, battery and charging, amoled display,dual speakerCons- camera\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24,Quite a smooth daily driver phone. The overall experience has been satisfactory, camera's good, durability also seems to be good, I've dropped it quite a few times & the gorilla glass 5 seems to be holding up. 120hz feels great. Charging speed is good too, nothing mind-blowing though. Battery life is decent. Lasts quite a bit, but since I keep it in the 120hz mode all the time, it's a little less for me. But I don't have any problem with battery life for now.,It does what the description says.Camera quality not upto the mark, compared to other redmi mobiles. Even A3 model clicks better pics.Finger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button. You need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read.Volume is good for both call and streaming.Fast charging but charger gets heated soon.Battery back up is good, unless you don't do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming.Dual app and dual space option is missing.Light weight and good video resolution.Overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography & gaming.,I bought this for my dad and it's working good for him, if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good Phone for elders or first time smartphone user.,Phone is good, but i facing weird bugs due to software issues. After that i manually installed latest global software then working fine.When i was using indian firmware, after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec, but after manual installation its working fine", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/411yU+n3UkL._SY300_SX300_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Storage-Qualcomm%C2%AE-SnapdragonTM-Included/dp/B09QS8V5N8/ref=sr_1_96?qid=1672895770&s=electronics&sr=1-96"}

My budget was around 20k max, and this one somehow fit in all ways. I had almost finalized one plus nord ce, but changed my mind at the last moment and I don't regret. I've used redmi phones before so I'm aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k+ exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone (one of the worst phones I've ever used, refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that). Here's my review of this phone based on 2 months of usage:Pros:1. Build quality is good. Finishing and lookwise it's sleek and quite comfortable in hand.2. Back camera is really good, better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures, although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality, but for the price range it's not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions, decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 40-45 mins from below 10% battery levels. Battery backup is decent, with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more.4. Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good! You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers. Pretty loud too.5. No lagging and smooth touch, refresh rate is pretty good.6. Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general, there are negligible auto installing bloatwares. Android 11 performance so far has been satisfactory.7. Hasslefree usage in general, something that I struggled with a lot with my earlier Techno spark phone for basic functionalities.Cons:1. Front camera could've been a lot better. In daylight conditions, picture colors aren't vibrant enough, and in low light, pictures come grainy. Dissatisfied with that.2. Amoled display isn't as good as I had expected, especially becomes evident when light reflects on the screen while you're watching something.Nothing else worth mentioning that I can think of right now. May update this review if anything encountered.For people with 15-20k budget looking for a good overall usage phone having 5G, this phone  is worth a shot along with Nord CE 2 Lite.,Nice phone with good battery backup,fast charging, sturdy body and good process speed... camera quality is not good enough..but overall.. good budget phone..,1) Battery is decent2) Charging is very fast3) Camera is averagingOverall nice product,The phone is good from all aspects bug if ur looking for a good camera this is not the one.,The price of the product is higher at the time of launch. Within 1 month it dropped by 3k.The price qty is ok.Some features are missing which are available in Chinese make model.,Pros1. Display(super amoled)2. Battery life(24 hrs moderate usage)3. Fast charging4. 120 hz refresh rate work seamlesslyCons1. Miui(lots of unnecessary apps)2.processor(sd 695 is too old)3.main Camera not up to the markOverall I just want to say if you're looking for a phone to watch movies and series and casual gaming go for it.(pubg, cod feels fantastic in this without any lag)If looking for heavy gaming or looking for a camera phone this one is not for you brother.,Good phone need improvement in camera,This mobile has the best camera compared with other models", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/410TBgL2KXL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Phantom-Additional-Exchange-Included/dp/B09T2WRLJJ/ref=sr_1_101?qid=1672895777&s=electronics&sr=1-101"}

My budget was around 20k max, and this one somehow fit in all ways. I had almost finalized one plus nord ce, but changed my mind at the last moment and I don't regret. I've used redmi phones before so I'm aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k+ exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone (one of the worst phones I've ever used, refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that). Here's my review of this phone based on 2 months of usage:Pros:1. Build quality is good. Finishing and lookwise it's sleek and quite comfortable in hand.2. Back camera is really good, better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures, although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality, but for the price range it's not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions, decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 40-45 mins from below 10% battery levels. Battery backup is decent, with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more.4. Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good! You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers. Pretty loud too.5. No lagging and smooth touch, refresh rate is pretty good.6. Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general, there are negligible auto installing bloatwares. Android 11 performance so far has been satisfactory.7. Hasslefree usage in general, something that I struggled with a lot with my earlier Techno spark phone for basic functionalities.Cons:1. Front camera could've been a lot better. In daylight conditions, picture colors aren't vibrant enough, and in low light, pictures come grainy. Dissatisfied with that.2. Amoled display isn't as good as I had expected, especially becomes evident when light reflects on the screen while you're watching something.Nothing else worth mentioning that I can think of right now. May update this review if anything encountered.For people with 15-20k budget looking for a good overall usage phone having 5G, this phone  is worth a shot along with Nord CE 2 Lite.,Nice phone with good battery backup,fast charging, sturdy body and good process speed... camera quality is not good enough..but overall.. good budget phone..,1) Battery is decent2) Charging is very fast3) Camera is averagingOverall nice product,The phone is good from all aspects bug if ur looking for a good camera this is not the one.,The price of the product is higher at the time of launch. Within 1 month it dropped by 3k.The price qty is ok.Some features are missing which are available in Chinese make model.,Pros1. Display(super amoled)2. Battery life(24 hrs moderate usage)3. Fast charging4. 120 hz refresh rate work seamlesslyCons1. Miui(lots of unnecessary apps)2.processor(sd 695 is too old)3.main Camera not up to the markOverall I just want to say if you're looking for a phone to watch movies and series and casual gaming go for it.(pubg, cod feels fantastic in this without any lag)If looking for heavy gaming or looking for a camera phone this one is not for you brother.,Good phone need improvement in camera,This mobile has the best camera compared with other models", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41iEZV6nKbL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Stealth-Additional-Exchange-Included/dp/B09T2S8X9C/ref=sr_1_109?qid=1672895777&s=electronics&sr=1-109"}

I have not had to recharge it as frequently as I have had to with other power banks.In terms of durability, the MI Power Bank 3i has held up well over time. The construction is solid and the power bank has not suffered any damage despite being carried around in my bag on a daily basis.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and would highly recommend it to others.

I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures.

But this is does not catch fingerprint at allIf u pay 500 INr higher u will get the spigen ones which protects the front sensors tooHappy with my purchase and moving forward will be applying spigen screen guards for all my products,This is hands down THE BEST screen protector for iPhones. I got the iPhone 13 one and it\u2019s excellent. So easy to install, anybody can do it! It\u2019s so smooth and soft to touch and fits perfectly on my iPhone. Highly recommended. Maybe bit pricey but you get 2 in the box. Fingerprint free and smudge free.,Very nice product to buy.This tempered glass is easy to install no need to worry about airbubbles while installing tempered glass.it is very easy to install on any mobiles as it designed for.worth for your money.,The quality and adhesion is good. Instalation was pretty easy.What i would have liked1. Had it had a black bezel so it blends well with the phone so that no one could make out that a protective tempered glass is stuck.2. Had it also covered the front camera like the ESR protective glass does, it would have been better.3. Would have appreciated a price around 500, definitely overpriced.,Super easy to install. The screen guard got attached without any hassles and was perfect fit. The EZ fit tray works like magic.,I used this product for my iPhone 13 Pro with a peak design phone case. The quality of the screen protector is excellent and the engineering concept used for the installation is the best I\u2019ve ever seen. They even include useful tools and guidelines to minimise the possibility of error.", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Usew0lrWL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Spigen-Tempered-Screen-Protector-iPhone/dp/B095RTJH1M/ref=sr_1_123?qid=1672895777&s=electronics&sr=1-123"}
