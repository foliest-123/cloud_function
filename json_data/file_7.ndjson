These are cheating us, off course they didn\u2019t force to buy, but being middle class person/human being we may get attract to things which showing better in less price. Seems this made/gave opportunity to these sellers to cheat us.Amazon Delivery Feedback: I may not comment on all deliveries happening not safely but when it came to me it\u2019s not delivered safely.This TV came for home delivery in Troalley Auto without proper placement/safety, asked delivery person why alone kept it while coming due to up and downs of road it may fly right. He didn\u2019t listen my words, simply said will take it back if any physical damage.He only open it and as outside nothing see damage, Delivery person said if any inner damage during installation time Technician came to know and will replace it and he forced me to tell OTP to accept me deliver and left.TV Installation Feedback: Did by Amazon Technician PersonInstead MI Technician, Amazon Technician came and installed this MI TV. I got it installed Stand mount as wall mount not freely providing.Technician somehow explained TV usage but thinking as not MI person not have full knowledge and exploring and telling each details.However, normal usage of TV, this amazon technician help is fine.TV Experience:First day: Having slight less picture quality and few showing pixels not as required for Eye safeness.After 3 or 4 days: Picture quality came better. Sound/Audio quality was good either on OTT/Youtbe or Setup box/DTHUp to 11 days: As we not used much and simply using it for watch DTH channels. Everything looks good.After 12 days: Amazon replacement time expired then started showing sound/Audio problem.TV sound coming very slow, When installed time/first 10 days, if we set up Volume 15 or 20 it was able give bigger sound, now though we increase volume 60 or 65 not giving the sound that we heard when it installed/setup (Played the same content which we listen in Youtube when after installation completed).Regarding this yesterday raised request, online service person asked me to update build version to latest, Now, it is PL.6036 but still have the same problem.2 or 3 days ago while watching suddenly TV got turned off, We did power off and on then it got switch on usually, also after sometime did screen mirroring of youtube and tried decreasing volume from mobile it worked. But, not sure what problem, we believe after that time onwards we have this sound issues.Not sure, seems as I bought from this Amazon or MI service itself does magic to convey customer without actually solving problem.Online service person instead sending Technician to home for verifying problem. Told and did build version update with me to latest (Software update). Later, he said Volume limit got increased to 100 now, we have to increase the volume level double or triple to have same sound which have prior. i.e. Before if 15/20 volume level gives big sound, then now 50/60 volume level the same sound. Asked, when limit increased it should give much more sound otherwise what is the use of Volume limit increase. But, he told OTT/some apps will show difference of this new feature, at the time as I have been on this calls and worries, got tired, I said will see and get back to you with new request.After some time, when I visited my friends/ better knowledge person on this problem came to know that he cheated me without solving problem, simply said some words to convey/tired us.Off course,  I can hear sound at 60 or 70 Volume but my concern is after purchase/installation of 13 days only I got this problem, in future how it works and how many further problems shows to me making me cruise.Being middle class person, we give value to single rupee also because we know how much efforts we put on to get that money. After purchase of this MI product crying lot why we went to it instead we could have went for further good brand product though they high in cost.Now, not replaced my TV or not did service by Technician. We decided that we got cheated on and prayed God to take care\u2026\u2026,Bought two years ago. My panel stopped displaying just one week before the warranty was to expire after two years. They promptly replaced it with a new one. I did not even spend one rupee extra.  Hassle-free. Highly recommend buying Mi products. The product is also awesome.,Good,Best product", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/51xmNdrIlcS._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Mi-inches-Ready-Android-Black/dp/B084872DQY/ref=sr_1_488?qid=1672909149&s=electronics&sr=1-488"}

The TV is still going strong - all the good points mentioned in the original review below are still true and very happy with the TV.It's as if OnePlus have been listening to their customers! After recent firmware updates, the issues I had mentioned have almost disappeared.1. We can now arrange and move apps (YouTube, Netflix) as per our wish on the home screen itself. I am finally able to put YouTube first as it is the most used app for my toddler.2. There is no more wifi disconnect issue noted earlier.3. Prime Video still shows errors sometimes. Though I think that's an issue with the app and not the TV.Strongly recommend this TV!Original Review:I took a leap of faith in purchasing this TV as there were mixed reviews for it. However, after using it for 2 months, the following are my observations:Good:1. The picture quality is fantastic. There is no lag while watching/forwarding 4k/8k videos.2. I saw a youtube review which said its brightness was low compared to other models - The brightness is more than you would ever need from a TV. I have never needed to run it on full brightness till now, up to 40 works for me. For my toddler to watch rhymes, I set brightness to 0, and even then it is more than needed.3. There were a few reviews that said the sound quality was average and you need a soundbar. I disagree - I have watched movies with up to 50 sound and that is good enough for a 1000 sqft hall.4. Voice command - it is quite accurate and I am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around 15 - 20 feet away.5. Being able to control the TV from app is also a very useful feature - no need to look for remote. Being able to cast from the app also helps a lot. It would be even better if everything on phone (not just pictures and videos) could be cast using the appNot so good:1. If the TV goes to sleep/screensaver for more than 10 minutes,a. it often gets disconnected from wifi - have to restart it againb. prime video fails to resume - displays error - and have to restart the TV againc. On the home screen, you cannot rearrange apps to have your preferred apps first. You can do it in apps window which is useless as you need to navigate to it first - easier to navigate to your preferred app in the home screen itself.,Only Cons till now got, fast moving object looks blurr, which was known before buying by other user review, but i got this tv in 32 k,Ao over all satishfied,Only minus that too critical is the installation service provider.The product is to installed by v care installation services provider.The installation service provider is a total waste and not responded properly.Actual date of installation was on 21.02.22 but was only done by the service provider on 27.10.22.The executive who attended the installation is a total waste person and don't know how to behave to the customer.He behaved very rudely.The installation service provider is a total damage and waste. Not at all worth.,,Awesome quality of pictures and some issues with smart features like in app installation and in connection from smart phone only audio player in work properly but video not show in tv.,Dolby atom 4 k video etc,Good,Good", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41sSPp4pkYL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-163-8-inches-Android-65U1S/dp/B095JPKPH3/ref=sr_1_492?qid=1672909149&s=electronics&sr=1-492"}

Switch on the TV, and it already knew me, and my Amazon Prime Account.  After a brief online security check, all my content and apps automatically appeared on-screen, and setup was done!OPTICAL AUDIO OUTI'm using a JBL soundbar with sub-woofer which are connected to my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV using an optical cable (not supplied), and by simply changing settings on the TV my audio system automatically switches on and off with the TV, and the supplied TV Remote has volume controls for my cinema sound.  The sound reproduction is First Class.  I can't comment on the built-in TV Speakers, because I haven't used them.PICTURE QUALITYThere are lots of presets for the screen, including Natural, Cinema, Gaming, etc., and you can also set a customised screen to your own liking.  The picture quality is excellent, every bit as good as my other TV from a famous brand that costs 4X the price of my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV.  I'm impressed!HDMI & CONNECTIVITYI'm only using HDMI1 because all my content is streamed and I have been using an Amazon Firestick, and Google Chromecast.  The Chromecast is plugged into HDMI1, and the TV automatically switches to it when you want to use it.  However, I don't think I'll be using the Chromecast much, because Fire TV is so good, and has an amazing remote control.I'm also using a 2TB External hard drive plugged into the fast USB.  Playing movies, even in HD, is a perfect experience with no lag or juddering.Access to the sockets on the wall-mounted TV is OK if you have small arms, and although I'm only using HDMI1, Optical Audio Out and one USB, there is plenty of connectivity for other equipment.JUST ONE THING...This version of FireTV only allows Alexa to speak 2 languages, viz.

Only con is you can't silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime, hope they fix it with an update.Built quality and looks (4.5/5) - metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting. Best thing is, it also looks good over skinny wrists(poor me, with 5.6 inch wrist). Only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guard.Touch screen (5/5) - it's almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k. I bet you will not get any laggy experience ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - SpO2 and HR has fairly decent accuracies, it gives you a rough idea of your being, so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k. Count steps with decent accuracy as well. Sleep accuracy is also just acceptable.To sum up, you should definitely go for this watch if you've a budget, constrained under 2000 rs,,I recently purchased the Fire Bolt Phoniex watch, which is quite stylish, and the Bluetooth calling is excellent. The voice gets to the other side without any disturbance.The build quality is good over the wrists, but you can get scratches on the display, so protect it with some screen guard. You should go for this watch if you want a budget-friendly smartwatch under 2000.,It's a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls you.....i think you should purchase it if in future company add these two features...,I recently purchased the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, and I am very happy with my purchase. The watch is quite stylish, and I get compliments every time I wear it. The watch is also quite comfortable to wear, and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size. The watch also has a great battery life, and I can go for days without having to charge it. The watch also has a number of features, including a step counter, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracker. All of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watch.,This watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money. Really pleased with the design and shape of watch, definitely a must buy for every person .loved the colour, durability and accuracy is super \ud83d\udc4d. just go for it.,I liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking, sp02, Heart rate measuring, music player, temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have 2 games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a Ben 10 Omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome look", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41sHRWXCfvL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Fire-Boltt-Phoenix-Bluetooth-Calling-Monitoring/dp/B0B3RRWSF6/ref=sr_1_4?qid=1672895748&s=electronics&sr=1-4"}

Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team.

Review 1 is 30 days after purchase (Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now) and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update. These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022.Before OOS 13 update, 5G (only for Jio) was enabled via another update. 5G is still not available in my region. Hence, 5G related parameters are not covered in this review.Review 2: After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update (Android 13):(Update received on 1 Dec 2023).Note: After the beta update, no new issues popped up.i.e., there were;No Heating related issues.No fast battery drain.No change in the Charging time.No annoying bugs.No change in camera performance.Beta update is mostly like a Stable update.OOS 13 (Android 13) update review:Delighters:> No new apps added. Absolutely NOT.> System storage consumption remains the same (13.2 GB).> Animations are more fluidic.> More customization UI features added. (Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder & lot more.)> Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier.> Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor.> Ability to play videos in the background & screen OFF as well (even for YouTube)  (Really a welcoming & longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF)> Stand-by battery life has improved substantially.Disappointers:> Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before.> No improvement in Sound levels. Still initial 40% is too silent.> No Dolby Atomos (which was mentioned for OOS 13). Perhaps, to wait for Stable update.> Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier. Response time is tad increased.> Haptics have become tighter than earlier, but still not stronger.=======================================================================Review 1:Verdict - A Good Buy in this price range in 2022.Note:- This review is after a month's usage.- Received 2 updates during the course of time (Recent update was of 0.98 GB).- System consumes 13.2 GB space. 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage.- N77 band is missing for 5G.- The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue.- Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile. No noticeable difference observed. ( In Non-gaming aspect)- Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parameters.Things that are delighting;> Exceptional signal reception (especially 4G+ carrier aggregation). Very fast download speeds.> Insane Fast charging (0 to 100% in 40 mins, 30 to 100 % in 20 mins, excluding trickle charge). No heating of the mobile (just slight warming) during charging.> Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic (Even more than 7.5 hrs, for Videos, YT and general tasks and calls, even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver.> Oxygen OS = Color OS/Realme OS - Bloatware. The skin is really good & nothing to complain like other brands' UI.> Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps. Even some 2nd party apps are \"un-installable\". No major bothering bugs noticed till date.> Yes, the \"Alert slider\" is included, unlike some premium OnePlus models.Things that are annoying;> Dual ambient light sensor (1 in rear and other in front) is not well calibrated. The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required.> Volume level is useless until 40% level (can be audible only in \"Pin-drop silence ambience). Audible enough only post 40% level. Stereo speakers output are 70% bottom and 30 % earpiece. But full volume doesn't distort & is loud enough.> Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40% and best only @ 90% level)> Hotspot drains battery quickly (even a warning notification pops up). Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly. Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm).> Though the in-hand feel is good, the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit.> Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel.> The inbuild DAC (no 3.5 mm hole and only Type-C port) is not great. The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio output.,Overall it's a good mobile phone. The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long. Not much, i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about 18-20 hours on normal use.. not many themes available.

Most things work great. Has great battery life. As a dailywear, there's not much to worry about. It detects activity but that happens only after a considerable amount of time (20 minutes). One cannot change the activity detection sensitivity or time.The watch is not very intuitive to use. It's usually great and most features can be accessed easily but certain things take more clicks and taps than should be required in a compact device. So all the features are there, but it takes a bit of time to find them.Sleep tracking is decent.Phone calls have good quality. People can hear your voice even if there is reasonable disturbance. If you answered through your phone and now want to switch to your watch, you cannot do that. And you can only save at most 10 contacts. You cannot dial numbers. But the mic and speaker of the watch is goodAlso, a confusing thing is, why does the watch not have audio alarms, when it is capable of producing sound?,What i need in watch is not available so don't need this...can get it in normal watch from other brands,Look and feel is awesome. This is great product suggestions from Amazon. Thanks,I like the step count and heart rate accuracy. Not sure about stress count sometimes it shows inaccurate.,Bluetooth connectivity needs to be improve and touch also,All ok, but anti scratch glass required in this watch,Good watch go for it", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Peg4pz7fL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Noise-Bluetooth-Calling-Tracking-Detection/dp/B0B5LVS732/ref=sr_1_13?qid=1672895748&s=electronics&sr=1-13"}

Biggest disadvantage of this device is it's in box charger which is only 7.75 watts (5v, 1.55a) that takes about 3 hours for a decent charge.,\ud83d\udd25 Heating issues during use with in 15 minutes uses.Touch screen \ud83d\udcf1 issues some times it's too great and some time u have to touch several times even on samsung key pad while typing.We all family are using samsung mobiles but this time I worried of issues if I have to face same issues i have to change mobile and transfer data it's very irritating work I wish to if any one of samsung is reading this review please reply me through Amazon.\ud83d\udd25 15 \u092e\u093f\u0928\u091f \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0909\u092a\u092f\u094b\u0917 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u094c\u0930\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0940\u091f\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0964\u091f\u091a \u0938\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0928 \ud83d\udcf1 \u0915\u092d\u0940-\u0915\u092d\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u092f\u0939 \u092c\u0939\u0941\u0924 \u092c\u0922\u093c\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0914\u0930 \u0915\u092d\u0940-\u0915\u092d\u0940 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u094b \u091f\u093e\u0907\u092a \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u0938\u092e\u092f \u0938\u0948\u092e\u0938\u0902\u0917 \u0915\u0941\u0902\u091c\u0940 \u092a\u0948\u0921 \u092a\u0930 \u092d\u0940 \u0915\u0908 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u0938\u094d\u092a\u0930\u094d\u0936 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u092a\u0921\u093c\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964\u0939\u092e \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0930 \u0938\u0948\u092e\u0938\u0902\u0917 \u092e\u094b\u092c\u093e\u0907\u0932 \u0915\u093e \u0909\u092a\u092f\u094b\u0917 \u0915\u0930 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u0932\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0928 \u0907\u0938 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0926\u094b\u0902 \u0938\u0947 \u091a\u093f\u0902\u0924\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u0942\u0902 \u0905\u0917\u0930 \u092e\u0941\u091d\u0947 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0926\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u093e \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u092a\u0921\u093c\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0924\u094b \u092e\u0941\u091d\u0947 \u092e\u094b\u092c\u093e\u0907\u0932 \u092c\u0926\u0932\u0928\u093e \u0939\u094b\u0917\u093e \u0914\u0930 \u0921\u0947\u091f\u093e \u091f\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0902\u0938\u092b\u0930 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u0939\u094b\u0917\u093e \u092f\u0939 \u092c\u0939\u0941\u0924 \u092a\u0930\u0947\u0936\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u093e \u0915\u093e\u092e \u0939\u0948 \u0905\u0917\u0930 \u0915\u094b\u0908 \u0938\u0948\u092e\u0938\u0902\u0917 \u0907\u0938 \u0938\u092e\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e \u0915\u094b \u092a\u0922\u093c \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0924\u094b \u0915\u0943\u092a\u092f\u093e \u092e\u0941\u091d\u0947 \u0905\u092e\u0947\u091c\u093c\u0945\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u092e\u093e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u092e \u0938\u0947 \u0909\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0902 .,Bought for mom as she just want to use for calls. She is not a selfie or video person.Didnt want to go for Realme/Xiaomi(redmi/poco) products because of their support. This already comes with Android 12 and two year updates are assured.The display is really good. Not full HD screen though. Call quality is good.I wanted a smaller size but unfortunately, the price doesnt fall under 10 for them.If you are buying for lots of photos/videos, this is not the phone for you.If you want to use for call & do basic things like whatsapp and other things, this would be a good phone for you.,This phone was bought for a first time smartphone user.  It was a good fit for the said user.  Thank you Samsung and Amazon.,Normal phone with very average screen quality. Battery backup also not very good. But yes its worth it. Thumbs up under this budget.,Samsung m04 exlent mobile. battery and screen best quality,rejonabule price,midle class best of mobile,Better price with discount. Performing well,AN AFFORDABLE MOBILE FROM A PREMIUM COMPANY. \u2764\ufe0f", "img_link": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41kg-+XWoxL._SY300_SX300_.jpg", "product_link": "https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Storage-MediaTek-Battery/dp/B0BMGB3CH9/ref=sr_1_17?qid=1672895748&s=electronics&sr=1-17"}
